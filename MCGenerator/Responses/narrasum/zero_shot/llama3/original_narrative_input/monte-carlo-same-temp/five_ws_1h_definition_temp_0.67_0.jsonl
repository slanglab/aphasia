How did the main character do what s/he did?\n\nStory: Victim: Four victims (deceased) On the case: Gil Grissom, Nick Stokes, Sara Sidle\n\nGrissom, Nick and Sara arrive on the scene of a mass murder, four Buddhist monks from Thailand lay dead in their temple. Another monk, Ananda, who claims to have been at a bank depositing money they'd gathered to build a school during the murders, called for help. Each victim was shot between the eyes at close range, one at a time. A gang sign belonging to a gang known as \"The Snakebacks\" is carved into the wall. Grissom concludes that they sat still because they were praying for whoever shot them. In a temple garden, Grissom finds a potential murder weapon, a rifle.||||| When the room is processed, Sara extracts a recent boot print from the carpet floor, even though shoes are not supposed to be worn inside a Buddhist temple. She also finds a trace amount of a blue material on a statue and a used chewing gum on another. When Ananda's office is searched, the CSIs find a porn magazine, which is strange since Buddhism discourages seeking pleasure. The lab confirms that the rifle is the murder weapon. It also has Ananda's prints on it. At the autopsy, Doc Robbins explains that the area where all victims were shot corresponds to the Sixth Chakra. In Buddhism, the Chakras are the body's seven energy centers. The Sixth Chakra, also known as \"the Third Eye\", is the hub of higher consciousness. When Ananda is brought in for questioning, he explains that he found the rifle in his office and carried it outdoors because his faith doesn't allow weapons in the temple. The porn magazine was left in the temple by a visitor and Ananda kept it in case that person came back for it.||||| A further fingerprint analysis confirms that Ananda never touched the trigger of the gun; the locations of the prints are consistent with his story that he only carried the gun. Nick suspects that the gang sign is a false lead; after a number of murders, the LVPD came down hard on the Snakebacks and brought the whole gang down. Through David in autopsy, Grissom contacts a local Air Force base. Since 9/11, they keep satellite surveillance of bases and other key buildings. Since the temple is close to a base, it is within the range of a satellite. A photo shows a car with vanity plates \"PROUDUS\" outside the temple close to the time of the murders. The car is registered to Peter Hutchins Sr., a local diner owner who was unhappy with the monks having a temple so close to his establishment, blaming them for the drop in local stores' business. Inside the car, Sara finds a set of prayer beads that doesn't belong to Hutchins Sr.||||| At the lab, the CSIs learn that Peter Hutchins Sr. has an alibi for the murders. Greg examines the blue substance found on a statue and determines that it is paintball paint. Grissom, Nick and Sara visit a nearby paintball field, where Hutchins' son, Pete Hutchins Jr., is playing. Sara compares a shoe print left by his boot to the boot print found on the scene and sees that it is similar. Pete is brought in for questioning, accompanied by his father, and denies having been to the temple.||||| When pressured with the boot print, Pete claims to have brought some friends in to look into the rumors that there was money and drugs inside. When Grissom remarks that the lab's dust lifter only works on recent prints, Pete confesses that a friend took a gold statue from the temple when they were there. He went there to return it and found the monks as he was taking off his boots. He didn't call the police because he was afraid that he would become a suspect. When Grissom asks how he knew he was supposed to remove his boots when entering the temple, Pete admits, to his father's shame, to being interested in Buddhism and considering the monks his friends.||||| With Pete cleared, Greg examines the chewing gum found on a statue and finds trace amounts of curry and saffron on it. Grissom consults with Ananda and presents the lab's findings to him. The spices found on the gum suggest that someone ate them and then chewed the gum. Ananda shows Grissom the temple's kitchen, the cooking of which uses curry and saffron. O'Riley confronts the two with some new evidence: even though the monks raised ca. $13 000 for their charity project, Ananda only deposited $12 000 when he was at the bank. The account was opened the same day as the murders were committed.||||| Before that, Ananda kept the money in a box in his office. Grissom examines the box and finds curry powder inside. Suspicion falls on the temple's part-time cook, David Suddahara, whom Ananda caught stealing from the charity fund, which is why Ananda opened a bank account to keep the money safe. In interrogation, Suddahara confesses to the murders and Grissom confirms that his DNA matches that from the chewing gum from the scene. He thought Ananda was going to report him, went home, got his rifle and returned. Finding that Ananda was gone, he panicked and executed the monks, one by one. When Grissom asks Suddahara why he shot the monks in the Sixth Chakra, he only replies \"I shot them between the eyes.\" With the case closed, Grissom pays a visit to the temple and sees Pete Hutchins Jr. engaged in meditation with a monk.||||| Victim: Stephanie Watson (deceased) On the case: Catherine Willows, Warrick Brown In a separate storyline, Catherine meets up with Jimmy Tadero, her old mentor, at bar. Catherine brings up Dwight Kelso, who was convicted of killing her best friend, Stephanie Watson, during her dancer days. Kelso, who recently died of cancer in prison, made a television appearance on his deathbed. He confessed to killing a man in Reno, but maintains that he didn't kill Stephanie. Even though Kelso had been seen harassing her at the bar and had a knife cut on his hand when he was arrested a block away from the murder site, Catherine still feels insecure about the case. Together with Warrick, she signs out the case evidence, which is due to be destroyed, and re-examines it in the lab. When she and Greg examine the murder weapon, a bloody knife, they notice a small spot of blood that wasn't examined at the time of the murder. Catherine figures that it was ignored because the lab couldn't get a DNA sample from such a small amount.||||| When the test results come back, they show that the small spot is not from Kelso or Stephanie, but a third contributor, a male. Ecklie is initially a bit angry that the evidence was signed out without his knowledge, but gets onboard when he learns of the new evidence. In the display room, Warrick goes over the crime scene photos and notices that a glove that belonged to Kelso and was found on the scene isn't in a single crime scene photo or sketch. Catherine becomes suspicious when she learns that it was logged by Jimmy - two days after the murder. Catherine takes Jimmy to the crime scene to go over the crime again. He shows her the dumpster in which the glove was found, claiming the arresting officer didn't see the glove because it was dark and he was busy grabbing Kelso. Jimmy is offended when Catherine asks whether he tampered with the evidence.||||| Back at the lab, Warrick runs more tests on the knife and finds remains of saliva in the blood on both the glove and the knife - Kelso's saliva. Catherine suspects that the blood came from a mouth injury and was then transferred from the glove onto the knife. She confronts Jimmy, who admits that he \"helped the evidence along\". When Kelso was arrested, the DA didn't feel like there was enough non-circumstantial evidence to charge him with the murder and he was released. Jimmy attacked Kelso outside, beating him while he taunted him about the murder. Jimmy then shoved the glove into his face, where blood from his beaten mouth stained it. He then transferred some of the blood from the glove onto the knife, planting DNA evidence. Catherine tells him that, with all the new information, Jimmy is a suspect for the murder himself since he had a crush on Stephanie and even proposed to her a week before she was killed, though she turned him down. He refuses to give her a sample of his DNA without a warrant, which Catherine gets.||||| When the DNA test results come back, Jimmy is brought in for questioning. The test proves that the blood on the knife is not his, nor is it a match to anyone connected to the case or anyone in CODIS. Jimmy is furious when he learns that Catherine will make sure he is prosecuted to the full extent of the law, even though he could get life in prison or even the death penalty. He calls Catherine ungrateful, saying she would have started prostituting herself if he hadn't gotten her out of dancing. Catherine rebuts this, saying she earned her career as a CSI and only danced. She remarks that Jimmy sold his integrity to get a case solved and because of that, the real killer got away with it. She asks \"Between the two of us, who's the whore?\". She promises to follow Jimmy all the way through his proceedings and has him arrested. In the final scene of the episode, Catherine returns the Stephanie Watson evidence to the storage and marks the box \"DO NOT DESTROY - CASE UNSOLVED\".\nPlease provide a list of main concepts mentioned in the above story using the 5 W's, 1 H retell strategy.", "original_narrative": "Victim: Four victims (deceased) On the case: Gil Grissom, Nick Stokes, Sara Sidle\n\nGrissom, Nick and Sara arrive on the scene of a mass murder, four Buddhist monks from Thailand lay dead in their temple. Another monk, Ananda, who claims to have been at a bank depositing money they'd gathered to build a school during the murders, called for help. Each victim was shot between the eyes at close range, one at a time. A gang sign belonging to a gang known as \"The Snakebacks\" is carved into the wall. Grissom concludes that they sat still because they were praying for whoever shot them. In a temple garden, Grissom finds a potential murder weapon, a rifle.||||| When the room is processed, Sara extracts a recent boot print from the carpet floor, even though shoes are not supposed to be worn inside a Buddhist temple. She also finds a trace amount of a blue material on a statue and a used chewing gum on another. When Ananda's office is searched, the CSIs find a porn magazine, which is strange since Buddhism discourages seeking pleasure. The lab confirms that the rifle is the murder weapon. It also has Ananda's prints on it. At the autopsy, Doc Robbins explains that the area where all victims were shot corresponds to the Sixth Chakra. In Buddhism, the Chakras are the body's seven energy centers. The Sixth Chakra, also known as \"the Third Eye\", is the hub of higher consciousness. When Ananda is brought in for questioning, he explains that he found the rifle in his office and carried it outdoors because his faith doesn't allow weapons in the temple. The porn magazine was left in the temple by a visitor and Ananda kept it in case that person came back for it.||||| A further fingerprint analysis confirms that Ananda never touched the trigger of the gun; the locations of the prints are consistent with his story that he only carried the gun. Nick suspects that the gang sign is a false lead; after a number of murders, the LVPD came down hard on the Snakebacks and brought the whole gang down. Through David in autopsy, Grissom contacts a local Air Force base. Since 9/11, they keep satellite surveillance of bases and other key buildings. Since the temple is close to a base, it is within the range of a satellite. A photo shows a car with vanity plates \"PROUDUS\" outside the temple close to the time of the murders. The car is registered to Peter Hutchins Sr., a local diner owner who was unhappy with the monks having a temple so close to his establishment, blaming them for the drop in local stores' business. Inside the car, Sara finds a set of prayer beads that doesn't belong to Hutchins Sr.||||| At the lab, the CSIs learn that Peter Hutchins Sr. has an alibi for the murders. Greg examines the blue substance found on a statue and determines that it is paintball paint. Grissom, Nick and Sara visit a nearby paintball field, where Hutchins' son, Pete Hutchins Jr., is playing. Sara compares a shoe print left by his boot to the boot print found on the scene and sees that it is similar. Pete is brought in for questioning, accompanied by his father, and denies having been to the temple.||||| When pressured with the boot print, Pete claims to have brought some friends in to look into the rumors that there was money and drugs inside. When Grissom remarks that the lab's dust lifter only works on recent prints, Pete confesses that a friend took a gold statue from the temple when they were there. He went there to return it and found the monks as he was taking off his boots. He didn't call the police because he was afraid that he would become a suspect. When Grissom asks how he knew he was supposed to remove his boots when entering the temple, Pete admits, to his father's shame, to being interested in Buddhism and considering the monks his friends.||||| With Pete cleared, Greg examines the chewing gum found on a statue and finds trace amounts of curry and saffron on it. Grissom consults with Ananda and presents the lab's findings to him. The spices found on the gum suggest that someone ate them and then chewed the gum.

The film opens on Markham, his wife Jean (Meg Foster), his young son Tommy (William Rodriguez), and his daughter Heather (Yara Vaneau) having a picnic on the edge of the jungle, which is being cleared for the dam's construction. Tommy wanders from the cleared area, and an Indian (Rui Polanah) from one of the indigenous tribes known as the Invisible People notices Tommy and takes him. Markham pursues the pair into the forest but does not find his son. Ten years later, the dam is nearing completion. A 17-year-old Tommy (Charley Boorman), now called Tomme, has become one of the Invisible People. When his father, Chief Wanadi, the man who took and adopted Tommy, notices Tomme is now smitten with girls, he initiates Tomme's coming-of-age rite, after which Tomme undergoes a vision quest. Tomme's spirit animal tells him he must retrieve sacred stones from a remote spot deep in the jungle. Wanadi warns him that the quest will be dangerous, as it will take him into the territory of the cannibalistic Fierce People.||||| Meanwhile, Markham has finally identified his son's abductors. Markham and a journalist decide to set off bottle rockets to attract the attention of the Invisible People. Instead, they attract the Fierce People and are captured. Armed with a CAR-15 carbine, Markham is able to defend himself long enough to talk with Chief Jacareh (Claudio Moreno) who releases Markham for the night, promising to hunt him down in the morning, while the Fierce People kill and butcher the journalist. Close to dawn, Markham stumbles into Tomme collecting the sacred stones. The two recognize each other just as the Fierce People arrive, shooting Markham in the shoulder. Tomme and his father manage to escape, leaving Markham's carbine behind. In the care of the Invisible People, Markham recovers from his injuries and discovers that his son has chosen a wife, a young woman named Kachiri (Dira Paes). Jacareh, recognizing the destructive power of Markham's carbine, visits a seedy brothel at the edge of the construction zone and arranges to exchange women for ammunition and more guns.||||| Wanadi presides over the wedding, with Markham seated in honour next to the chief; Markham watches as Tomme and Kachiri are wedded; he is still grief-stricken, even still upset with Wanadi, for his son being taken; Markham asks Chief Wanadi why he took Tommy all those years ago. Wanadi answered that he thought the white people must be terribly unhappy, since they were destroying the forest, but Tommy smiled at the Invisible People when he saw them; the Chief took Tommy to save him. Wanadi has Markham given the herb to instigate Markham's own vision quest, and he wakes up back at the dam's construction zone. Tomme and his friends return to their village to discover that many of the Invisible People have been murdered and all the young women abducted by the Fierce People.||||| Tracking the Fierce People, they find their women inside a building protected by unfamiliar, and deadly, technology. In the ensuing battle, the Fierce People kill several members of the Invisible People, including Chief Wanadi.

In desperation to hold what he already has and the effort to get more, he contemplates the plan of robbing old Sharp. Annie's father, on the night of the day he collected his rents. Sharp is a miserly old man and secretes his money about his house, instead of trusting it to a bank.||||| Bob discovers Ralph trying to break into the house and in the encounter that follows Bob is downed and Ralph escapes. The former is taken for the would-be robber and is next sentenced to twenty years in the penitentiary. On his release, he vows to kill Ralph, who married Annie the day he was sentenced. Ralph, a sick and broken man, goes to the mountains to try and recover his health, accompanied by his daughter, who strongly resembles her dead mother. Ralph, now prematurely old, has been out of confinement long enough to wear off the prison pallor, and is a dead shot now, well healed for vengeance. As the pair come driving up the mountain trail. Bob keeps Ralph covered with a rifle from his ambush. Just as he is about to press the trigger and send the bullet home, he sees reflected in the face of the girl, the memory of her mother, whom he loved in the lonely years that have gone.

The Governor beats up Milton after learning he burnt the walker pits and betrayed him. The Governor offers Milton a knife and tells him he can get back into his good graces by killing Andrea, but Milton turns and tries to kill The Governor instead. The Governor grabs the knife and stabs Milton several times, fatally wounding him. He leaves Milton to die, expecting him to reanimate and kill Andrea, noting that \"In this life now, you kill or you die. Or you die and you kill\". The Governor then goes to join the army of men ready to attack the prison. Tyreese (Chad L. Coleman) informs The Governor he and Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) will stay behind to protect the citizens of Woodbury, as they only kill walkers, not humans. The Governor, after a moment, agrees and gives Tyreese a gun, and thanks him.||||| At the prison, Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and his group pack up supplies in cars. Rick is still seeing hallucinations of Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies), making him question his judgement. Michonne (Danai Gurira) finds Rick and forgives him for his decision to try to turn her over to The Governor, and thanks him for his decision to bring her into the group. Rick admits it was Carl's (Chandler Riggs) choice, believing she belonged here. Elsewhere, Daryl (Norman Reedus) talks through his grief of losing his brother Merle (Michael Rooker) with Carol (Melissa McBride). She reminds him that Merle gave them a chance against The Governor. Later, a small army from Woodbury arrives at the prison. They use their heavy weapons to break through the outer walls and breach the fences with their vehicles. The prison, outside of walkers, appears empty.||||| As they search the cell blocks they find a Bible left by Hershel open to a highlighted passage John 5:29, \"And shall come forth: they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.\" The Governor angrily tosses the book aside and orders his men to search \"the tombs\", the maze of hallways within the prison. However, Rick and the others are hiding in the tombs, and ambush The Governor and his men who flee in a confused panic. The Woodbury army retreats from the prison, ignoring The Governor's orders to hold their ground and re-attack. A young man from the Woodbury group escapes on foot and runs into Carl and Hershel who were waiting out the attack in the woods on the perimeter of the prison.||||| Hershel and Carl hold the man at gunpoint, and Hershel demands the young man hand over his weapon. As he slowly complies with Hershel's demand, Carl unexpectedly and deliberately shoots the man. Some distance from the prison, The Governor catches up to the fleeing convoy and orders them to return to the prison. When they insist on returning to Woodbury, The Governor proceeds to kill them all, including Allen (Daniel Thomas May). He only leaves alive his lieutenants Martinez (Jose Pablo Cantillo) and Shumpert (Travis Love), though he is unaware Karen (Melissa Ponzio) has hidden herself under the bodies to avoid being killed. The Governor, Martinez, and Shumpert drive off. In Woodbury, Tyreese warns Sasha they may need to slip away before The Governor's return.||||| Milton tries to retain consciousness long enough to help Andrea escape, and tells her he left a pair of pliers on the floor behind her she can use to break the handcuffs restraining her to the chair. Andrea reaches back with her right foot and tries to pull the pliers forward. In the prison, Hershel tells Rick about Carl's execution of the surrendering Woodbury man, and explains in no uncertain terms Carl \"gunned him down.\" Rick, Michonne, and Daryl leave to chase down The Governor, fearing he may attack again, while the others guard the prison. The three discover the Woodbury convoy and find Karen hiding in a truck, who explains what happened. They continue to Woodbury and engage in a firefight with Tyreese and Sasha, until Karen speaks up and explains what she saw. Tyreese allows the group to come in and Rick realizes that Andrea never returned to the prison.

Rick, Michonne and Daryl sit with Andrea and grapple briefly with her impending turn from Milton's bite. Rick tells her everyone is safe at the prison and Andrea is glad that Michonne has found Rick's group.

Unfortunately, they soon come to train tunnel. Going around will take a day.||||| Naturally, Glenn refuses to wait so Abraham declares that they'll part ways now. It's simply too dangerous to Eugene -- to them all. Glenn and Tara head into the tunnel. Daryl and his new gang find an abandoned warehouse full of cars. All the gas is gone -- someone beat them to it -- but it does provide a good place to rest. The gang all \"claim\" cars in which to sleep before Daryl can, leaving him to recline on the ground.

Eugene has calculated that, if Glenn and Tara traveled at around 3 MPH, they would either nearby or just about to emerge from the tunnel.

Daryl accuses Len of planting the rabbit. Joe seems unsure -- and then punches Len in the face. \"I saw him do it,\" Joe says with a shrug.

The priest knows who Steve is by letters he had written to Paolo talking about a woman named Nina, and asks Steve to tell him about the war. Steve relates what happened in 1944, when Italy was still occupied by the Germans: As a fighter pilot and squadron leader in Corsica, Steve completes his 200th mission and is about to be shipped home. When his replacement and good friend, Captain George Peterson, does not return from a mission needed for the impending invasion of Italy, Steve decides to take his place the next day. The squad cannot identify their strategic target, a tunnel that houses a German munitions supply, and Steve is forced to parachute out of his plane after it is hit.||||| Although the German ground soldiers see Steve's descent, he eludes them and seeks help from a local farmer. The farmer's wife fears the Germans and turns him away, but Steve is soon approached by Nina, a young woman who is part of an Italian guerrilla force. Nina leads Steve to a mountain cabin where he meets Bruno, leader of the small band. Although he is a patriot, Bruno fears that Steve's presence will bring severe retaliations against the villagers, including his mother, and tells Steve that he will have to stay put before finding his way back to Corsica. A few days later, Steve sees a formation of American planes fly overhead and realizes that the target still eludes them. He and Nina, who are attracted to each other, kiss, even though Steve has told her that he has a girl at home. Later, Steve tells Bruno that he is planning to leave that night.||||| Although Aldo, an embittered member of the band who is in love with Nina, lashes out at Steve, Bruno defends him and agrees to help. In the afternoon, the men go down from the hills, stop a German Panzer with a grenade and steal its weapons. A few minutes later, a truck full of German soldiers arrives, but the Italians manage to escape. Back at the cabin, Steve tells the men about the tunnel, but Bruno and the others are afraid that if they help, German retaliation will be too severe. Nina lashes out at the men for being too afraid to take chances, then leaves the cabin. Steve follows her and kisses her, promising that he will be with her even after the war, but telling her that she cannot come with him now. She agrees, but asks him to wait until morning when Father Paolo, who is a fearless patriot, can help him.||||| The next day, Nina takes Steve to see Fr. Paolo, who has been hiding George in the church since he was shot down. Paolo then reveals that Bruno's mother died when she fell from a truck, trying to escape from the Germans. Just then, two German soldiers barge in, with guns drawn. Nina distracts the soldiers by screaming, and in the melee, the Germans are killed. George, Nina and Steve then return to the cabin. On the way, they see a German roadblock and Nina distracts the soldiers long enough for George and Steve to capture them. That night, at the cabin, Nina tells Bruno what happened to his mother and he decides to help Steve blow up the tunnel.||||| During the planning, they observe that Aldo is gone, and when he returns carrying a goat, Nina is suspicious because Aldo hates goats. Later, the men notice an unusually large number of German patrols. At the same time, two of the men, Mario and Ettore, are captured by the Germans while getting supplies. Although Ettore is killed, Mario escapes. Meanwhile, at the cabin, Bruno begins to suspect that there is a spy in the group. Just then Mario comes back and tells them what happened. Convinced that someone is a traitor, Bruno suggests a secret vote to determine who it is. Steve does not like this, and refuses to vote, but everyone else, except Aldo, names Aldo. Bruno is about to beat the truth out of Aldo when German soldiers approach the cabin in force.||||| Bruno and the others tie Aldo to a chair and shoot their way out, leaving Aldo to be killed by the Germans. Next morning, Steve, George and the others move into place to blow up the tunnel, while American planes fly overhead. After Steve lights a flare he has kept in his pocket, some of the planes investigate, identify the semi-obscured target and start to bomb it. While the Italians take out some of the German artillery crews, Bruno is killed, but the rest manage to direct one of the large guns to explode the ammunition, thus destroying the tunnel. A short time later, on the coast, Paolo and other patriots help Steve and George escape in a small boat. After kissing Nina goodbye, Steve promises to come back, but Paolo warns her that soldiers are known for short memories.

Didi and Stu feel thoroughly prepared for this special occasion by consulting Lipschitz and creating a birthday checklist. The adults don't notice that Tommy is watching a dog food commercial on TV. Feeling inspired by the ad, Tommy breaks out of his highchair and crawls over to his dog Spike's food bowl (full of canned dog food). At the last minute Grandpa Lou catches Tommy and tells him he doesn't want dog food, he wants his baby food breakfast. But when Lou looks at Tommy's baby food he admits that dog food does look more appetizing by comparison!||||| The day rolls on and Betty and Howard DeVille arrive for the party with their twins, Phil and Lil, and Chuckie Finster, the neighbors' son. When they're all gathered in the playpen, Tommy tells them about the dog food commercial, and his belief that if they eat dog food, they'll turn into dogs. The other babies find this appealing and decide they want to be dogs, too.||||| But before they can leave the playpen, the grownups put party hats on the babies and snap pictures, though the babies aren't thrilled by either one. Soon, Stu's older brother Drew arrives with his daughter Angelica (who, not unlike Tommy, is wearing a special birthday party dress for the occasion). Angelica gleefully poses for pictures with the babies, though roughly. Tommy tells Angelica about the dog food, who enjoys the idea of biting the mailman and agrees to go along with Tommy's plan to get dog food. But before they can do anything, it's time to open presents. Angelica is greedy and wants Tommy's presents for herself. Stu made Tommy's present himself: a remote control flying saucer. Didi and Grandpa Lou both doubt that even a grownup can fly it, but Stu insists Tommy can figure it out.||||| The doorbell rings, signaling the arrival of the puppet stand and puppets the Pickles' booked for the party. But there are no professional puppeteers to go with the stand, leaving Stu and Drew to perform themselves (and Didi worrying that her son's first birthday won't be perfect). They decide to perform the climax of Little Red Riding Hood, but they quickly begin to argue over how the lines go. Lou tries to tell them to cut it out (with a puppet of his own), however it doesn't work and they continue to bicker. Meanwhile Grandpa Boris, Didi's father, complains about the cake she baked.

Dr. Ranbir Sartain, Michael's new psychiatrist after Dr. Loomis' death, inform them that Michael is able to speak, but chooses not to.||||| Dana records the event as Aaron approaches Michael and talks to him, but fails to get him to speak, even after showing him his mask and mentioning Laurie Strode. The two journalists leave Smith's Grove Sanitarium and drive to Laurie's house, a heavily fortified and decrepit homestead, and bribe her for an interview, which she reluctantly accepts. Laurie has spent the last forty years dealing with post-traumatic stress and preparing for Michael's inevitable return. Her feelings have resulted in two failed marriages and losing custody of her daughter Karen at a young age. Aaron and Dana tell Laurie their interest in finding out why Michael committed the murders in 1978 and ask her to meet with him in a final attempt to get him to speak before he's transferred to a maximum security prison. Laurie kicks them out of her house, but not before taking the money they offered.||||| Allyson with her friends As the transport is being prepared and patients are loaded onto the bus, Dr. Sartain insists on accompanying Michael, and the bus departs. In Haddonfield, Laurie's granddaughter and Karen's daughter, Allyson, is walking to school with two friends and tells them the stress that her family endures due to her grandmother's past, and debunks the town rumor that Michael is Laurie's brother. In class, Allyson looks out of the window to see Laurie watching her.||||| She meets with her grandmother who gives her the three thousand dollars from Aaron and Dana and tells her to have fun. During a family dinner at Karen's house, Laurie arrives and has a panic attack and Allyson comforts her. Meanwhile, the bus transport crashed in a ditch, the security guards were killed, and the inmates were scattered about the road. A man and his son driving down the road happen upon the bus and investigate. While the father disappears, his son grabs a rifle from the truck and encounters a fatally wounded security guard that tells him to run. He investigates the bus and is startled by Dr. Sartain, shooting him in the shoulder accidentally. Fleeing back to the truck, he calls the police; Michael appears from the back seat and kills him.||||| The following morning, Sheriff Frank Hawkins explains to a deputy that Michael Myers escaped the transport and will most certainly return to Haddonfield to finish what he started four decades prior. Aaron and Dana arrive at a gas station; Dana leaves Aaron to use the bathroom while he goes inside to pay for the gas. With the inside of the station deserted, he stumbles upon a dead mechanic missing his overalls and a cashier whose jaw was ripped open. Meanwhile, Michael attacks Dana in the bathroom, and when Aaron arrives to save Dana, Michael kills him by bashing him into the door numerous times, killing him, before strangling Dana to death. Michael inspects their vehicle and recovers his mask, putting it on. Laurie learns about the transport crash and breaks into Karen's house to demonstrate her lack of security. After a brief argument about Michael with Karen and her husband, Ray, Laurie leaves and heads to the gas station in time to witness the bodies of Aaron and Dana being recovered.||||| On Halloween night, Michael wanders a populated street in Haddonfield, littered with families and children trick-or-treating. He finds his way into a shed behind a house and takes a hammer before going inside to kill the sole occupant. He replaces the hammer with a kitchen knife and moves to the house next door, killing another woman by stabbing the knife through her throat. Allyson is at a school-sanctioned Halloween party with her friends and receives a call from Vicky, inviting her to come over once Julian, the kid she's babysitting, falls asleep.||||| Allyson gets into an altercation with her boyfriend, Cameron, who throws her phone, just as Laurie was calling to warn her to go home. At Julian's house, he tells Vicky that he saw a masked man standing in the doorway, but Vicky dismisses it as his imagination and puts Julian to bed as her boyfriend, Dave, arrives. As Vicky checks the closet at Julian's request, she opens the door and is attacked by Michael who was hiding inside; Julian flees the house and calls the police. Laurie, patrolling the streets in her truck, hears the dispatch call on her CB radio and hurries to the house, where Sheriff Hawkins is investigating. He finds Vicky's corpse and Laurie shoots Michael through a window, only to find out it's his reflection in a mirror. Laurie and Hawkins patrol behind the neighboring houses and find Michael; Laurie shoots him, but as she turns the corner, Michael is gone.||||| Laurie and Allyson\n\nAllyson ditches her boyfriend at the party and allows her friend Oscar to walk her home. Allyson rejects his advances and Oscar lags behind, spotting Michael watching him. Oscar tries to escape, but is caught on a fence and Michael impales him. Allyson turns back and finds Oscar's body and is chased by Michael before finding refuge in a neighboring home. Karen and Ray arrive at Laurie's fortified home and wait for Allyson to arrive.||||| Hawkins encounters Dr. Sartain and in turn, find Allyson during their search for Michael. Finding Michael, Hawkins runs him over with the police SUV and gets out of the vehicle to shoot Michael at point-blank range, despite Dr. Sartain's protests. Dr. Sartain stabs Hawkins in the throat with a blade hidden inside of a pen and kills him before taking Michael's mask and trying it on. Dr. Sartain loads Michael into the back of the vehicle with Allyson and drives to Laurie's house, intent on reuniting them. Michael regains consciousness and reclaims his mask, and Allyson informs Dr. Sartain that Michael spoke to her; distracted by demanding to know what Michael said, Michael breaks through the security barrier, forces Dr. Sartain out of the vehicle, and stomps on his head as Allyson flees on foot.||||| Ray steps outside to offer coffee to the police officers stationed outside Laurie's house and finds them dead. Michael appears behind Ray and strangles him. Laurie alerts Karen to Michael's arrival and sends her into the hidden safe room as she locks and barricades the front door. Michael breaks through the glass panels in the door and attacks Laurie, who escapes by shooting Michael's hand with a shotgun, stripping him of two fingers, forcing him to retreat. Laurie patrols her house room by room and seals each room off with security gates. Laurie encounters Michael upstairs; Allyson arrives as Laurie and Michael stab each other and witnesses Laurie fall from the balcony.||||| When she investigates, Laurie is gone and Allyson makes her way into the safe room with Karen, who alerts Michael. As he appears, Karen shoots him with a rifle and stuns him. Laurie appears from the shadows and attacks Michael, sending him tumbling down the steps into the safe room. Karen and Allyson leave the safe room, but Michael regains consciousness and grabs Karen's ankle. Allyson stabs Michael with his own knife and the two escape the room. Laurie flips a switch and metal bars spring into place, barricading the exit and trapping Michael in the safe room as it fills with gas. Laurie lights a flare and tosses it through the bars, setting the room ablaze with Michael in it. Laurie, Karen, and Allyson escape as the house is engulfed in flames and hitch a ride in the back of a pickup truck coming down the road.

How did the main character do what s/he did?\n\nStory: Damon and Stefan are continuing with their killing spree. Sybil calls Damon and asks him to bring her a ball called the striker he'd stolen from Peter earlier . Meanwhile, Bonnie and Enzo return from their trip to Paris. Enzo gifted her a necklace filled with his blood. Seline meets with Caroline and Bonnie and explains that there are three pieces of the bell: the bell itself in her possession, the tuning fork in Caroline's possession and the striker in Damon's possession. When it's assembled it can hurt the sirens.||||| Meanwhile, the Miss Mystic Falls Pageant takes place at the Founders' Hall and both Salvatore brothers and Sybil attend. Sybil asks Damon to give her the striker and he refuses. Bonnie and Enzo talk about his gift and if he expects her to turn into a vampire at some point. She argues that she can't turn because she's still linked to Elena and doesn't know what would happen if she does turn. She later return the necklace to him because it may be a symbol of something she does not want to promise. Caroline asks Damon to give her the striker, complete the bell and kill Sybil. Damon refuses this wanting Sybil to fix him first.||||| The pageant starts and Damon has fractions of memories of his time with Elena at their pageant in 2010. Caroline argues that he wants to remember Elena. The pageant is cut short when Caroline evacuates the people. The girls demand to say who won the pageant and Caroline says it's a six-way tie. They're not happy with the answer and want to stay because Stefan compelled them to do so. Elsewhere, Dorian visits Seline indenting to avenge his friend Georgie and be a distraction while Matt looks for the bell, but Seline convinces him to team up against Sybil. She reveals that only a member of the Donovan family can ring the bell. At the same time Matt goes to Seline's home to look for the bell.

Sybil asks Damon to give her the striker and he refuses. Bonnie and Enzo talk about his gift and if he expects her to turn into a vampire at some point. She argues that she can't turn because she's still linked to Elena and doesn't know what would happen if she does turn.

After announcing that her daughter is no longer a concern, Alpha takes out a shotgun and tells Daryl to come with her alone. At dawn, Alpha forces Daryl to the top of a cliff where a gargantuan horde of walkers and Whisperers walk beneath them.

Veeram used to live in Thoothikudi and is a big fan of Singam, confirming that Bhai and Danny are currently in prison while Thangaraj has been killed.

Although one wonders if Sheldon had spent more time with the razor and scissors, as he bears more of a resemblance to the evil Mr. Spock (or perhaps Howie Mandel with hair) than the Geico Insurance cavemen look the other three were sporting. Naturally, Sheldon thought the expedition went wonderfully. Perhaps it was because his mom's church group prayed for his safety. (Well, she thinks it worked and told Sheldon that.) To be fair, Leonard found the return home pretty good. Of course, having Penny practically jump him, kiss him passionately, and drag him into her apartment might have had something to do with it. HOWARD: Dammit.||||| I should have gone over and told her we were back. RAJ: (sarcastically) Yeah. It was \"first come, first serve.\" To say Sheldon was pleased with the results of his experiments would be an understatement. Although he appreciated the contributions of Howard and Raj, he can't mention them in his Nobel acceptance speech. However, they will get an effusive footnote (and a signed copy!) of his memoirs. This would probably be a good time to tell Sheldon the truth, since Sheldon's Vulcan hearing can pick up whispers from another room. Sheldon thinks they want to talk about having to sleep together naked to conserve body heat the one night the power went out. What Sheldon thought were magnetic monopoles he discovered to prove String Theory correct were actually caused by operating the electric can opener and causing static. The reason they did that is because Sheldon wasn't finding any at first and he started acting like an obnoxious giant dictator.||||| RAJ: I thought we were going to be gentle with him. HOWARD: That's why I added the \"-tator\". It helped the guys from not wanting to kill Sheldon because it made him colon-Capital D. (in the world of emoticons) Finding this out made Sheldon become colon-Captial O. He feels betrayed, especially by Leonard. Sheldon demands to see Leonard, who would prefer not interrupting his makeout session with Penny. (BTW Kaley, whatever you were doing during hiatus, keep doing that.) Since Leonard refuses to answer to Sheldon's knock, Sheldon decides to demand to talk to Penny. SHELDON: I realize you're currently at the mercy of your primitive biological urges, but as you have a lifetime of poor decisions ahead of you, may I interrupt this one? Sheldon tells how the three fed him false data in his experiments. Penny wants to know why. Leonard says it was to keep him happy and prevent them from throwing Sheldon's Kindle outside and then locking him out when he went to get it.||||| SHELDON: That seems like a bit of an overreaction! LEONARD: No. An overreaction would be to tie your limbs to 4 different sled dog teams and yell \"mush!\" The original data was still available, but Sheldon already sent an email claiming he solved String Theory. Sending a retraction email would humiliate Sheldon in front of the whole university. Penny takes Sheldon's side in this and goes to talk to him. She tries her best, even singing Soft Kitty, which only works when he is sick. He's unconsolable, since not only was the three months at the North Pole for nothing, he missed Comic Con. Penny tries, though. She tells him a story about being told a rumor she would be head cheerleader in high school before they named Valerie Mossbacher head cheerleader (the big ol' slutbag!). She was devastated. Her mom even made her a celebratory pie. SHELDON: Are you saying a celebration pie is even comparable to a Nobel prize?||||| PENNY: Well, they're pretty tasty. SHELDON: And on a different but not unrelated topic, based on your efforts to buoy my spirits, do you think you were ever fit to be a cheer-LEADER? OK, one more try. Penny tries to compare what the guys did to the new Star Trek movie when Kirk took over the ship and told Spock all those things that weren't true, like not caring his mother died. SHELDON: I missed Comic Con AND the new Star Trek movie!!! (he's bawling like a 3-year-old)||||| At the university, the guys have shaved, except for Howard's mustache. (the \"Clooney\" or the \"Mario and Luigi\", depending on your opinion) Leonard is spared having to give too many details about whether he and Penny had sex as Sheldon comes in and refuses to sit with them...and unsuccessfully tries to choke Leonard by using The Force. They try to apologize again, but he's not having it. Having Kripke come in and telling Sheldon he \"destwoyed his weputation\" with the retwaction email didn't help. Sheldon tries to defend himself to the cafeteria by invoking the \"biggest blunder\" Einstein admitted to, but since that blunder was later proven correct, that makes Sheldon a big \"woser.\"||||| Leonard returns to Penny to give her the gift he wanted before getting interrupted: a preserved snowflake from the North Pole. He begins to explain how he preserved it, but this apparently is the most effective way to get Penny to kiss him. He is again interrupted by Howard and Raj, who report that Sheldon has resigned from the university and went back to Texas, based on the phone call Leonard receives from Sheldon's mother.||||| Her powers of persuasion are not limited to working on Sheldon, as the three of them are on a plane to Texas to bring him back. (Penny promises to still be there when they get back.) LEONARD: I don't want to go to Texas! HOWARD: And I do? My people already crossed the desert once. We're done! At home, Sheldon is getting used to doing things the way he used to, which includes prayer before every meal. But his mom was nice enough to cut a smiley face into his grilled cheese, so a little \"God's neat, let's eat\" never hurt anybody. She recalls that they had sat together like this when he was a kid, when the neighborhood kids would hate him. Sheldon thinks they were too stupid to know they hated him because of his intelligence, but actually they did know that.||||| Leonard, Howard, and Raj make it down there. Raj is disappointed he won't get to see a cattle drive, but at least they have steaks on sale at the Costco. It turns out Raj can't talk to Sheldon's mother, either. However, a woman at her church might be able to do a healing thing she does with the crutch and wheelchair crowd, and she might be willing to take a shot at \"whatever Third World demon is rolling around\" in him. Leonard wants to get back to L.A. quickly. (\"A girl?||||| I've been praying for you.\") She calls Sheldon out, but Sheldon refuses their apology, as he is convinced he is now destined to teach Evolution to a bunch of Creationists. MRS. COOPER: You watch your mouth, Shelly. Everyone's entitled to their opinion. SHELDON: Evolution is not opinion, it's fact. MRS. COOPER: And that is YOUR opinion! (pause)\n\nSHELDON: I forgive you. Let's go home! MRS. COOPER: Don't tell me prayer doesn't work! Finally returning to L.A. Leonard can get back to Penny, and they FINALLY have sex! Leonard doesn't see why it has to be weird for friends to have sex. They were friends, and now they're more than friends. It is what it is. PENNY: Leonard? It's weird.

Things go well at first, but everything changes after discovering a tunnel in the basement leading into the house from an unknown place. An evil presence is shown to be lurking within, unknown to the family. Unusual and paranormal activities occur, such as unknown forces banging on the door at night when nobody is outside and an ugly demonic message painted on the wall of Janice's room.||||| For the latter, Anthony blames and beats his children, Jan and Mark, then beats Dolores for intervening, resulting in a fight between the entire family. Concerned by these developments, Dolores tries to have the local Catholic priest, Father Frank Adamsky, bless the house, but an argument breaks out within the family shortly after Adamsky arrives. After Anthony shouts and hits the younger children, Adamsky tries to intervene but Anthony rudely orders him to leave. To Dolores' mortification, Adamsky leaves, disgusted at Anthony's behavior. He finds his car door open and the Bible on the passenger seat torn to pieces. The situation inside the home continues to deteriorate; Anthony is shown to be strict, abusive, sacrilegious towards the Catholic faith, violent towards his family and forcing his wife to have sex with him against her will. Dolores tries to keep things together for the youngest children. Also, Sonny and Patricia are revealed to have started to have sexual feelings for each other, due to mutual attraction that neither can act on.||||| The family goes to church with Anthony, so he can apologize for being rude to Adamsky. Sonny stays at home, claiming to feel unwell. He soon hears an alarming noise and goes downstairs to get his father's gun. He hears demonic laughter and follows it to the tunnel in the basement. The unseen presence pursues a frightened Sonny to his room, and he then falls victim to a demonic possession. Now possessed, Sonny approaches Patricia to play a game with him. They pretend he is a famous photographer and she is his nude model. Patricia agrees to pose naked and the pair end up having incestuous sex.||||| Patricia is then seen at confession, confessing the act and telling the priest that he does it to \"hurt God\" but not quite revealing who the culprit is. Sonny becomes more sinister and demonic, as his face starts contorting demonically. Startled, he tries to keep his family away, but is unsuccessful due to the demon's influence. On Sonny's birthday, he isolates himself from his birthday party, calls Patricia and she goes to check on him. She tells him she does not feel guilty about what they have been doing, but due to his demonic phases and his body's gradual demonic contortions, Sonny sends her away, using foul language. Patricia runs away crying, and she tries to tell Adamsky that she thinks Sonny is possessed, but he does not respond. Later that night, the evil spirit tells Sonny to \"kill them all\". Sonny goes and gets his father's rifle, and shoots his parents, Jan, Mark, and Patricia, after hunting her down.||||| The next day the cops arrive, pick up the bodies, and Sonny is arrested. He lies and says he does not recall killing his family. Adamsky then realizes that Sonny is possessed and asks the bishops if he can perform an exorcism on him, but they refuse, not believing him. He takes it upon himself to perform an exorcism, without the support of the Catholic Church. After freeing him from police custody, he takes Sonny to church. Sonny attacks him, and escapes after seeing the crosses on the doors. Adamsky runs after Sonny, traces him to the house, and performs the exorcism, releasing Sonny's soul.

As high school senior Bianca Piper (Mae Whitman) explains, now jocks play video games, the princesses are on anti-depressants, and the nerds are in charge. We then see the short, slightly-overweight unattractive Bianca walking down the halls with her two attractive best friends: Jessica 'Jess' Harris (Skyler Samuels), an aspiring fashion designer, and Casey Cordero (Bianca A. Santos), a tough computer hacker girl. All the guys drool over Jess and Casey, but nobody ever really acknowledges Bianca. The school's ruthless mean-girl queen bee Madison Morgan (Bella Thorne) invites Jess and Casey to a party at her house, and deliberately chooses not to invite Bianca, until Casey makes it so that there's a free invitation. Here, we also meet Bianca's neighbor and former friend Wesley Rush (Robbie Amell), captain of the football team and Madison's on/off boyfriend. Bianca also has a crush on a guy named Toby Tucker (Nick Eversman), but she is too scared to say more than two words to him.||||| The supervisor of the school newspaper and Bianca's teacher, Mr. Arthur (Ken Jeong), assigns her the task of writing an article for the school newspaper on the upcoming homecoming dance and what social life means to her. She reluctantly agrees to it. At home, we meet Bianca's mom Dottie (Allison Janney), who became a successful author after her divorce. She was inspired by an episode of \"The Simpsons\" to create a book on the five stages of dealing with divorce.||||| She, along with Jess and Casey, convince Bianca to go to the party, despite her hesitance. At the party, Wes runs into Bianca and asks her if Jess and Casey have mentioned him or are interested in him. Bianca says it's not her job to divulge information on her friends, to which Wes argues that it is as their DUFF. Wes explains to a confused Bianca that it stands for the \"Designated Ugly Fat Friend\", and that a DUFF is there to make their friends look better by comparison. They are approachable enough for someone to ask them about their hot friends, and Bianca fits this role. Offended, she throws her drink in Wes's face. She goes home alone feeling insecure and self-conscious.||||| Throughout the rest of the day, the thought of being a DUFF bugs Bianca until she realizes that everyone only talks to her to get closer to Jess and Casey. She even notices all the other social cliques at school with their own DUFF. It gets to a point where Bianca confronts Jess and Casey about being their DUFF. Despite their assurance that they don't see her like that, Bianca spitefully unfollows them from every form of social media (Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Vine, etc.) and decides she doesn't want to be friends with them at all. Bianca notices that Wes is failing chemistry. She sees this as an opportunity for the two of them to help each other out. She offers to tutor Wes if he agrees to turn her image around so that she won't be a DUFF. Wes agrees, but only if Bianca asks him in her monster voice from when they were kids. She does.||||| Wes joins Bianca at the local shopping mall where he first gets her to dress in a more flattering manner. As Bianca tries on different outfits, she fools around with a mannequin and pretends it's Toby. From afar, Madison's minion Caitlyn (Rebecca Weil) films this and sends the video to Madison. Wes then challenges Bianca to go around the mall and talk to a bunch of random guys for her to get over her fear of talking to Toby. It goes awkwardly for a while until one guy from a frozen yogurt stand talks to Bianca for a while. The next day, the video of Bianca at the mall goes viral throughout the school. Everybody points and laughs at her, forcing her to run into the bathroom and cry. Mr. Arthur and Principal Buchanon (Romany Malco) take notice of this and demand everybody turn in their cell phones to prevent further cyberbullying, which only turns everyone against Bianca even more since they blame her for the loss of their gadgets. Jess and Casey also see the video, and Casey gets rid of the video. The phones are returned to the students when the constant ringing bothers Buchanon.||||| Wes comes over to Bianca's house to apologize for not stopping the video and for not defending her. He gives her a dress that she had her eye on at the mall. He tells her not to let the video get to her and that she should approach Toby personally and admit how she feels. Wes then promises to go out and continue studying. Bianca approaches Toby at school after being previously humiliated by the video. She tells him she's into him, and he invites her to go over to his house to hang out. Bianca takes Wes into the nearby woods to her \"thinking rock\" so he can tell her how to handle herself on a date. He explains how the mood should be set and how Toby would act if he is trying to go for a kiss. Wes ends up kissing Bianca, but they laugh it off as just practice. Once again, Caitlyn is in the distance filming this with her video phone. Madison then approaches Bianca at school the next day and threatens to post another video at the mall of Bianca's awkward encounter with the guys since Madison doesn't like Bianca hanging around Wes.||||| Another evening or two later, Bianca goes to Toby's house for dinner. He puts out sushi and talks about how he got into writing songs. However, Bianca cannot stop thinking about Wes. She goes to the bathroom and tries to convince herself that she's not into him. Outside, Toby plays an awkwardly-written song for Bianca and then asks about Jess and Casey. Bianca slowly realizes that Toby is DUFF-ing her, and he admits he only invited Bianca over because he thought Jess and Casey would be joining them. Bianca leaves and then sees that Toby bought the sushi from another place instead of cooking it like he made it seem. Bianca goes home and leaves a message for Wes. She walks by the woods and sees him and Madison sitting on her rock, kissing. Wes comes over later to comfort Bianca, only to be turned away after she tells him what she saw.||||| Depressed, Bianca tries to write her article, only to become lonely. She decides to make amends with Jess and Casey. The two of them, along with Dottie, convince Bianca to go with them to homecoming. Jess makes Bianca a dress using Bianca's flannel shirt and another dress. The three girls go to the homecoming dance, and everyone is stunned by Bianca's new look, including Wes. She goes over to him and admits that she's into him. Madison catches them talking and threatens to post the video, but Bianca is no longer fazed by it.||||| She says that it won't bother her and that she doesn't care about labels the way Madison does. Bianca adds that everyone is a DUFF since there will always be someone prettier or more popular, but that shouldn't bother anybody. Moments later, Wes and Madison are crowned homecoming king and queen. Madison gladly accepts the crown, but Wes rejects it and goes over to kiss Bianca in front of everyone. They leave to go hook up in the computer room. Bianca writes her article on being a DUFF, which is a hit with the students. She and Wes become a couple in the end, and she becomes a more confident person that doesn't let a label define her.\nPlease provide a list of main concepts mentioned in the above story using the 5 W's, 1 H retell strategy.", "original_narrative": "For a long time, high school students have been stuck with the typical labels - jocks, princesses, nerds, divas, geeks, dweebs, rejects, etc. In recent years, these students have now branched out from their stereotypes.

How did the main character do what s/he did?\n\nStory: Professor Maggie Walsh talks about communication in class and then asks Buffy to come and lie on her desk for a demonstration. Riley steps forward and kisses Buffy, then the sun goes down. Buffy hears a young girl's voice and walks out of the classroom and into the halls where a girl holding a small box stands singing: Riley is behind her and reaches out to her shoulder. She turns around and instead sees one of the Gentlemen. Buffy wakes up to see she was dreaming in class. Willow teases her by saying the last 20 minutes of the class laid out everything for the final. Buffy smiles at her teasing and just says \"Just tell me I didn't snore.\" As they're leaving, Willow asks about her dream and Buffy says it was intense. Riley steps up behind them and says that was weird because she looked so peaceful whilst sleeping. They talk about their plans for the night. Both make up excuses for their real plans and part ways, unhappy that their courtship does not appear to be going anywhere.||||| Giles receives a phone call from Buffy and tries to research the information she gained from her dream about the Gentlemen. Spike makes himself very comfortable at Giles' place and complains about there not being any more Weetabix (despite having eaten it all himself -- again), claiming he likes to add it to his butcher's blood sometimes for texture. Repulsed by the mental image, Giles tells him to go and get some himself since he will no longer eat them now.||||| Xander and Anya arrive, arguing about whether Xander really loves her or -- because Xander can't vocalize the way he feels -- is only interested in her for sex. Her open voice on sex with Xander causes Giles to be repulsed and uncomfortable by it while Spike just finds Xander's situation amusing. Giles informs Xander that he has to keep Spike with him for a few days because an old girlfriend of his will be coming over from England. None of them are particularly pleased about the arrangement: Xander can't trust Spike to be in the same room as him without restraints, and Spike doesn't particularly want to be around Xander or Anya, especially if they intend to be intimate with him while he is tied to a chair in the same room. The three argue back and forth with Giles wearily in the middle.||||| Willow goes to her Wicca meeting but soon finds the girls are just wannabe Wiccans with no knowledge of real magicks . When Willow mentions the possibility of performing spells, the leader of the group just ridicules her. However, while the rest of wannabe Wiccans laugh one member, a girl called Tara , grows interested when Willow mentions actually performing magic. She tries to agree with Willow's suggestion, however she is very shy and after gathering the courage to speak up is quickly intimidated back into silence by the others. Willow realizes she's never going to learn anything from this group and speaks about it to Buffy, who complains to Willow how slowly her relationship with Riley is progressing, while Riley discusses the same with Forrest ; both conclude that the reason they cannot progress their relationship is because of both their inability to reveal their true identities to each other and the fact that Buffy starts babbling.||||| That night, before going to bed, Xander ties Spike down to a chair in his bedroom, even though Spike claims he wouldn't want to bite him even if he could. Spike begins an exaggerated imitation of Anya to annoy Xander. Olivia shows up at Giles' apartment, and after some brief talking they get right to kissing. At the clock tower, one of the Gentlemen opens a box, and the voices of all the people in Sunnydale float out of their mouths and are drawn into the box. When Buffy and Willow wake up the next morning and find they have no voices, they panic. Leaving their room, they see that nobody else in the dorms can speak, either. Xander, similarly panicked, blames Spike, whose gestured response is very clear. Riley and Forrest try to enter the underground lab, but without his voice Riley cannot activate the voice-based security system on the elevator door. Riley open a security panel and tries to put in a security code but gets it wrong several times. When the elevator opens they are cowed when Professor Walsh points out a sign saying they should have used the stairs in the event of emergencies.||||| Tara shows up at Stevenson hall looking around for Willow. A boy drops a glass and everyone jumps at the noise. When she doesn't see Willow she leaves. Buffy and Willow walk through the town, they see that Sunnydale is closed down -- except for bars and liquor stores. A doomsayer silently preaches it's the end of the world. People are sitting in random places, all sadly giving up or just stunned. They see someone selling dry erase boards for $10, at which Buffy rolls her eyes. Still they show up at Giles place armed with dry-erase boards hanging from their necks. A television news report states that everyone in Sunnydale has come down with a case of laryngitis and the town has been quarantined.||||| The threat of chaos looming that night, Buffy goes out to patrol, and Professor Walsh sends Riley and his team out incognito to maintain order. Riley and Buffy meet while walking out on the streets and as Riley is about to leave, he turns and kisses Buffy for the first time. Later that night, the Gentlemen and their demonic footmen lurk out into the night. Olivia wakes up in the middle of the night, and through the window she spies one of the Gentlemen, who travel by floating a foot in the air with their demon assistants, the Footmen , following on the ground. Two Gentlemen float through the UC Sunnydale dorms, finding a freshman boy. Their demon assistants hold the boy down while they cut out his heart. The next morning, Olivia draws a picture of the creature she saw. Giles sees in the paper that there was another similar murder the previous night and and recognizes what is happening. He puts aside his demonic volumes and pulls out a book: Fairy Tales .||||| In a lecture room at the college, Giles tells the story of the Gentlemen through very disturbing drawings and text on an overhead projector, with musical embellishment. Anya pulls out a bag of popcorn as they watch. Giles story tells how they travel into a town to collect seven human hearts, and they collect all the voices so that no-one can scream as a human voice is the only thing that can kill them.||||| Buffy mimes killing them with a stake and when they all look at her strangely she pulls out an actual stake and make the same miming motion. However Giles puts a sign up on the projector that they are immune to weaponry such as swords and stakes , in the tales \"The Princess screamed once, and they all died.\" Only the sound of a real human voice -- not a recorded one, despite Willow's suggestion -- can kill them and they have collected at least two of the seven human hearts they need. Unfortunately, Giles does not know how to get everyone's voices back, so has everyone else research. Giles puts up and image of Buffy on the projector, to which Buffy takes offence because it's hips are so wide. Despite that, it says she'll patrol. Riley and the rest of the Initiative suits up and then prepares to do the same.||||| Tara from the Wicca group tries to get to Willow's dorm when the Gentlemen chase after her. She finally makes it to Willow's dorm, and the two girls make a run for it. Riley is attacked by several of the Gentlemen's footmen in the clock tower, until Buffy shows up and starts fighting alongside him. The two are first shocked to see each other, but have neither time nor the ability to speak about it. Spike vamps out while drinking a mug of blood at Giles' house; as he bends down by the sofa on which Anya is sleeping, Xander sees blood on Spike's lip and the unconscious Anya and concludes Spike has bitten Anya. Xander punches Spike several times before Anya and Giles stop him. He then kisses her passionately, and, realizing he does indeed love her, Anya suggests, through not very subtle hand signals, that they have sex and the two quickly rush off.||||| Hiding in a laundry room, Willow and Tara try to push a vending machine against the door to block it, but due to Willows hurt ankle that she got when Tara accidently ran into her, they're not strong enough. Willow then tries to move it using magic, but she can only shake it a bit. Tara understands what she's trying to do, and clasps Willow's hand so they can combine their power. As soon as they hold hands, the vending machine slams against the door. Buffy gets caught by the Igor-like Footmen and the Gentlemen are about to cut into her when Riley shoots them with bolts of electricity. They fight and one of the demons grabs Buffy as she spots the box of voices on the table and recognizes it from her dream.||||| She points it out to Riley and, with great flair he smashes one of the vials sitting there. Buffy rolls her eyes and continues miming and he finally understands and smashes the box. Everyone's voice is returned, and Buffy lets out a loud and long scream, which causes the Gentlemen's heads to explode in a shower of green slime. The next day, Tara tells Willow that she was looking for her as she wanted to try a spell to restore the voices, knowing from the Wicca group that she was the only other person genuinely interested in it. The two talk, and Tara tells Willow that she's powerful, even if she doesn't know it yet. Giles and Olivia talk about how many scary things there really are and her reluctance to be part of Giles' world. In her dorm room, Buffy is visited by Riley. He tells her that they need to talk, and Buffy agrees. The two find themselves, once again, overcome by silence.\nPlease provide a list of main concepts mentioned in the above story using the 5 W's, 1 H retell strategy.", "original_narrative": "Professor Maggie Walsh talks about communication in class and then asks Buffy to come and lie on her desk for a demonstration. Riley steps forward and kisses Buffy, then the sun goes down. Buffy hears a young girl's voice and walks out of the classroom and into the halls where a girl holding a small box stands singing: Riley is behind her and reaches out to her shoulder. She turns around and instead sees one of the Gentlemen. Buffy wakes up to see she was dreaming in class. Willow teases her by saying the last 20 minutes of the class laid out everything for the final. Buffy smiles at her teasing and just says \"Just tell me I didn't snore.\" As they're leaving, Willow asks about her dream and Buffy says it was intense. Riley steps up behind them and says that was weird because she looked so peaceful whilst sleeping. They talk about their plans for the night. Both make up excuses for their real plans and part ways, unhappy that their courtship does not appear to be going anywhere.||||| Giles receives a phone call from Buffy and tries to research the information she gained from her dream about the Gentlemen. Spike makes himself very comfortable at Giles' place and complains about there not being any more Weetabix (despite having eaten it all himself -- again), claiming he likes to add it to his butcher's blood sometimes for texture. Repulsed by the mental image, Giles tells him to go and get some himself since he will no longer eat them now.||||| Xander and Anya arrive, arguing about whether Xander really loves her or -- because Xander can't vocalize the way he feels -- is only interested in her for sex. Her open voice on sex with Xander causes Giles to be repulsed and uncomfortable by it while Spike just finds Xander's situation amusing. Giles informs Xander that he has to keep Spike with him for a few days because an old girlfriend of his will be coming over from England. None of them are particularly pleased about the arrangement: Xander can't trust Spike to be in the same room as him without restraints, and Spike doesn't particularly want to be around Xander or Anya, especially if they intend to be intimate with him while he is tied to a chair in the same room. The three argue back and forth with Giles wearily in the middle.||||| Willow goes to her Wicca meeting but soon finds the girls are just wannabe Wiccans with no knowledge of real magicks . When Willow mentions the possibility of performing spells, the leader of the group just ridicules her. However, while the rest of wannabe Wiccans laugh one member, a girl called Tara , grows interested when Willow mentions actually performing magic. She tries to agree with Willow's suggestion, however she is very shy and after gathering the courage to speak up is quickly intimidated back into silence by the others. Willow realizes she's never going to learn anything from this group and speaks about it to Buffy, who complains to Willow how slowly her relationship with Riley is progressing, while Riley discusses the same with Forrest ; both conclude that the reason they cannot progress their relationship is because of both their inability to reveal their true identities to each other and the fact that Buffy starts babbling.||||| That night, before going to bed, Xander ties Spike down to a chair in his bedroom, even though Spike claims he wouldn't want to bite him even if he could. Spike begins an exaggerated imitation of Anya to annoy Xander. Olivia shows up at Giles' apartment, and after some brief talking they get right to kissing. At the clock tower, one of the Gentlemen opens a box, and the voices of all the people in Sunnydale float out of their mouths and are drawn into the box. When Buffy and Willow wake up the next morning and find they have no voices, they panic. Leaving their room, they see that nobody else in the dorms can speak, either. Xander, similarly panicked, blames Spike, whose gestured response is very clear. Riley and Forrest try to enter the underground lab, but without his voice Riley cannot activate the voice-based security system on the elevator door. Riley open a security panel and tries to put in a security code but gets it wrong several times. When the elevator opens they are cowed when Professor Walsh points out a sign saying they should have used the stairs in the event of emergencies.||||| Tara shows up at Stevenson hall looking around for Willow. A boy drops a glass and everyone jumps at the noise. When she doesn't see Willow she leaves. Buffy and Willow walk through the town, they see that Sunnydale is closed down -- except for bars and liquor stores. A doomsayer silently preaches it's the end of the world. People are sitting in random places, all sadly giving up or just stunned. They see someone selling dry erase boards for $10, at which Buffy rolls her eyes. Still they show up at Giles place armed with dry-erase boards hanging from their necks. A television news report states that everyone in Sunnydale has come down with a case of laryngitis and the town has been quarantined.||||| The threat of chaos looming that night, Buffy goes out to patrol, and Professor Walsh sends Riley and his team out incognito to maintain order. Riley and Buffy meet while walking out on the streets and as Riley is about to leave, he turns and kisses Buffy for the first time. Later that night, the Gentlemen and their demonic footmen lurk out into the night. Olivia wakes up in the middle of the night, and through the window she spies one of the Gentlemen, who travel by floating a foot in the air with their demon assistants, the Footmen , following on the ground. Two Gentlemen float through the UC Sunnydale dorms, finding a freshman boy. Their demon assistants hold the boy down while they cut out his heart. The next morning, Olivia draws a picture of the creature she saw. Giles sees in the paper that there was another similar murder the previous night and and recognizes what is happening. He puts aside his demonic volumes and pulls out a book: Fairy Tales .||||| In a lecture room at the college, Giles tells the story of the Gentlemen through very disturbing drawings and text on an overhead projector, with musical embellishment. Anya pulls out a bag of popcorn as they watch. Giles story tells how they travel into a town to collect seven human hearts, and they collect all the voices so that no-one can scream as a human voice is the only thing that can kill them.||||| Buffy mimes killing them with a stake and when they all look at her strangely she pulls out an actual stake and make the same miming motion. However Giles puts a sign up on the projector that they are immune to weaponry such as swords and stakes , in the tales \"The Princess screamed once, and they all died.\" Only the sound of a real human voice -- not a recorded one, despite Willow's suggestion -- can kill them and they have collected at least two of the seven human hearts they need. Unfortunately, Giles does not know how to get everyone's voices back, so has everyone else research. Giles puts up and image of Buffy on the projector, to which Buffy takes offence because it's hips are so wide. Despite that, it says she'll patrol. Riley and the rest of the Initiative suits up and then prepares to do the same.||||| Tara from the Wicca group tries to get to Willow's dorm when the Gentlemen chase after her. She finally makes it to Willow's dorm, and the two girls make a run for it. Riley is attacked by several of the Gentlemen's footmen in the clock tower, until Buffy shows up and starts fighting alongside him. The two are first shocked to see each other, but have neither time nor the ability to speak about it. Spike vamps out while drinking a mug of blood at Giles' house; as he bends down by the sofa on which Anya is sleeping, Xander sees blood on Spike's lip and the unconscious Anya and concludes Spike has bitten Anya. Xander punches Spike several times before Anya and Giles stop him. He then kisses her passionately, and, realizing he does indeed love her, Anya suggests, through not very subtle hand signals, that they have sex and the two quickly rush off.||||| Hiding in a laundry room, Willow and Tara try to push a vending machine against the door to block it, but due to Willows hurt ankle that she got when Tara accidently ran into her, they're not strong enough. Willow then tries to move it using magic, but she can only shake it a bit. Tara understands what she's trying to do, and clasps Willow's hand so they can combine their power. As soon as they hold hands, the vending machine slams against the door. Buffy gets caught by the Igor-like Footmen and the Gentlemen are about to cut into her when Riley shoots them with bolts of electricity. They fight and one of the demons grabs Buffy as she spots the box of voices on the table and recognizes it from her dream.||||| She points it out to Riley and, with great flair he smashes one of the vials sitting there. Buffy rolls her eyes and continues miming and he finally understands and smashes the box. Everyone's voice is returned, and Buffy lets out a loud and long scream, which causes the Gentlemen's heads to explode in a shower of green slime. The next day, Tara tells Willow that she was looking for her as she wanted to try a spell to restore the voices, knowing from the Wicca group that she was the only other person genuinely interested in it. The two talk, and Tara tells Willow that she's powerful, even if she doesn't know it yet.

She is notorious for being a 'kicker', and is now reflecting during lockdown on past events. Needy is a nerdy, substantially unpopular, \"plain Jane\" type student from Devil's Kettle, Minnesota, who has been best friends with Jennifer Check (Megan Fox), a beautiful, popular cheerleader, since their childhood. Needy's feelings toward Jennifer border on attraction. One evening, Jennifer has Needy accompany her to Melody Lane, a local bar, where an indie rock band named Low Shoulder is playing.||||| It seems unlikely that they would bother to perform in such a small town, but frontman Nikolai Wolf (Adam Brody) explains that it is a service to their fans. As Jennifer is fetching them drinks (getting past the age restriction barrier by flirting with the bartender), Needy overhears Nikolai referring to her as the \"State Fair Butter Queen\" - she loves to flirt and act promiscuously, but is in truth a virgin. During the performance, the bar catches on fire. Nikolai gazes on with a smirk, and Needy leads Jennifer to safety through the toilet window, just barely escaping from being killed in the blaze. Outside, they are accosted by the band, who made it out okay. Jennifer is in shock and Nikolai offers to lead them to \"somewhere safe\" in his van. Jennifer agrees in spite of Needy's protests and leaves with the band. Needy watches as the remains of the bar collapses to the ground.||||| Needy eventually makes it home where she finds a note from her divorced mother, stating that she is working swing shift this evening. Needy calls her boyfriend Chip (Johnny Simmons) to tell him what happened, and expresses her concern for Jennifer's safety. A bruised, bleeding Jennifer suddenly appears in Needy's home with torn clothing. Things get even stranger as Needy watches Jennifer tear wolfishly into a raw chicken in her fridge and monstrously roar at her, before spewing up a black, tar-like substance all over the floor. Jennifer further terrorizes Needy when she throws her against a wall and asks if she is scared of her. Jennifer then runs out the front door leaving a bewildered and frightened Needy behind.||||| The next day, the whole town mourns the tragedy of the bar fire, and Needy morosely remembers her childhood friend. Jennifer arrives at school acting as if nothing is wrong, and is completely unsympathetic to the victims of the fire. Jennifer meets up with the high school football captain, grieving the death of his best friend at the hands of the fire. She says his late friend suggested that they would have made a \"banging\" couple and leads him into the woods to ostensibly fulfill that request. As the two are kissing, her mouth transforms into a demonic gaping maw and she attacks him. Later that day, a highly-concerned teacher at the school finds the captain's grisly remains, and the town is rocked by the additional tragedy. Low Shoulder's song \"Through the Trees\" becomes a smashing success, and they donate 3% of their earnings to the cause of the victims. Needy questions the paltry effort, and wonders why they are credited with having rescued survivors while she herself knows that that is untrue.||||| A month passes by and Jennifer begins to look a little pale and gaunt, enigmatically explaining that \"it is wearing off\" and that she needs sustenance. Jennifer catches the eye of the school nerd Colin Gray (Kyle Gallner), and asks him to meet her at her house, though later making rude remarks to Needy about Colin's femininity and taste in music.||||| The next evening, Needy spends time with Chip, while Colin goes to meet Jennifer only to find that she has directed him to a still-in-construction house in a deserted neighborhood where she is in an upstairs room lit by various candles. Jennifer suddenly transforms into a snake-eyed humanoid creature, kills Colin, and sups on his flesh, as Needy has a vision of Jennifer that causes her to panic as Chip makes love to her. Needy drives home from Chip's house only to encounter Jennifer walking like an animal across the road before jumping onto her car's windshield. Needy returns home, only to find Jennifer sleeping in her bed and wearing one of Needy's shirts. They begin to passionately kiss until Needy snaps and demands to know what's happening. Needy orders Jennifer to leave, but Jennifer instead confesses what happened to her on the night the local bar burned down.||||| In a flashback sequence, Low Shoulder drove Jennifer out into a forested area, gleefully intending to offer her as a Satanic sacrifice in exchange for chart success. During the band's discussions, several wondered if Jennifer really was a virgin, which she insisted she was in the hopes that they would let her go. Using some instructions they downloaded off the internet, they spoke an incantation to the Devil, before stabbing her with a Bowie knife, which was then thrown into the notorious whirlpool off the nearby Devil's Kettle Falls.||||| Back in the present, Jennifer further explains to Needy that she found herself still alive (which Needy doubts), and then wandered away from the site after they had left, which is when Jennifer stumbled back to Needy's place that night. Jennifer also confides to Needy that when she is fully replenished with human flesh, she is indestructible. She demonstrates this by stabbing herself in the arm with a pocket knife, which immediately heals. Jennifer also tells Needy that on that same night, she came across the Indian exchange student that had survived the fire walking along the road, and devoured him and hid his body in the woods. Needy threatens to call the police, but Jennifer tells Needy that she will just deny everything and that no one will ever believe such a story. With that, Jennifer jumps out of Needy's second floor window and lands on the ground, completely uninjured, and runs off into the night.||||| Now more worried than ever, Needy goes to the occult section of their school's library and begins to do research. Needy soon finds where the band went wrong. Because Jennifer wasn't actually means a virgin, their sacrifice backfired - though it indeed brought them prosperity, it also turned Jennifer into a succubus, a female demon with a constant need to feed on young men to keep herself in good health. Needy realizes that the Spring Formal is approaching and that Jennifer could very well turn the dance into a bloodbath. She informs Chip about this and warns him not to attend the Formal, but he simply suggests that she get psychiatric help.||||| She breaks up with him in order to protect him, and he decides to attend in lieu of her warnings. The Spring Formal finally arrives, attended by Low Shoulder, who are now incredibly popular and have sold out a national tour. As they take the stage, Needy does not see Chip anywhere, so she leaves in pursuit of him. In the meanwhile, Jennifer confronts Chip in the woods, telling him that Needy was having an affair with Colin and that that was why she was so upset when the latter passed. Despite Chip affirming that he loves Needy, Jennifer kisses him ardently in an attempt to seduce him. She leads him to an abandoned mansion with a graffiti-filled indoor swimming pool. She kisses him again, but he rejects her yet again, causing her to throw him into the gunky water in a fit of rage.||||| Needy rushes towards the mansion to find a demonic, animalistic Jennifer and an injured Chip, still in the pool and suffering extensive blood loss due to Jennifer already having bitten him. Needy dives into the water to help Chip and maces Jennifer, causing her to vomit more black fluid. As Needy and Chip crawl out of the dirty swimming pool, Jennifer levitates above them. Needy confronts Jennifer about how she was never a good friend to her, and Jennifer threatens to kill her. Chip, uses the last of his energy to impale Jennifer through the stomach with a pool net's handle, before she escapes through a nearby window. Needy tries to call for help using Chip's phone, but it is damaged from being in the water. He dies in her arms, but not before the two profess their mutual love.||||| Needy wails as she mourns him. Needy, hell-bent on revenge, breaks into Jennifer's room, where she and her former best friend scuffle. Needy eventually yanks the \"Best Friends Forever\" locket from her former friend's neck and kills her by stabbing her through the heart with a box cutter. Jennifer's mother (Carrie Genzel) hears the noise and enters the bedroom to find Needy crouched over her daughter with the bloody knife. This results in Needy being taken to a mental institution. However, due to having been bitten by Jennifer during their fight, Needy has developed some demonic powers of her own, as well as Jennifer's evil personality - she has become vicious, ill-tempered, and anti-social with the orderlies and other residents. Isolated and abandoned by everyone she knows, she sets a plot in motion to escape. After a fight with an institution doctor, Needy is isolated in a cell. That night, she levitates herself to an overhead window, kicks it out with her superhuman strength, breaks through a nearby chain-link fence, and escapes into the night.||||| As she wanders down a rural road, she finds a watery runoff (which is where the nearby Devil Falls empties out into), along with the knife that Low Shoulder used to stab Jennifer, which she picks up. She flags down a passing vehicle and tells the driver she's following a band. The man exclaims that they must \"be one hell of a group,\" to which she then grimly explains that \"tonight's gonna be their last show.\" The end credits show Low Shoulder checking into a hotel post-concert and candidly indulging in drugs and alcohol in their hotel room. Eventually, the band is savagely murdered by a blurred figure. We then see police crime scene photos of the band members' corpses strewn around the hotel room, Nikolai having been stabbed in the chest with the sacrificial knife. The final image of the movie shows security camera footage of an evil-looking Needy walking down the hotel hallway past a gathering of female band groupies.\nPlease provide a list of main concepts mentioned in the above story using the 5 W's, 1 H retell strategy.", "original_narrative": "The opening scene depicts Anita \"Needy\" Lesnicky (Amanda Seyfriend), a violent inmate in a correctional facility.

Elizabeth brings this new information to her husband Philip (Matthew Rhys), who is wary, citing Prince's gambling addiction. Elizabeth believes Sanford is delivering them the \"highest source\" within the Reagan administration, while Philip believes it could be a trap. Elizabeth receives material from Prince at a dead drop, containing schematics for the U.S. missile defense system. She meets Claudia (Margo Martindale) who believes that the Americans wouldn't hand over such important information just as a trap, telling Elizabeth that she believes the Colonel is real and a meeting with him has been set.||||| Elizabeth has grown tired of Claudia as their handler and tells Philip that she wants her to be reassigned. Philip resolves to convince FBI employee Martha (Alison Wright) to plant a bug in Gaad's office to see if the FBI are planning anything. Later, while at dinner, Philip (disguised as FBI counterintelligence agent Clark) proposes to Martha, who happily accepts. Nina's (Annet Mahendru) suspicions about Stan Beeman (Noah Emmerich) grow and she accuses him of murdering Vlad, which he strongly denies. Philip asks Martha to plant a listening device in Gaad's office and she agrees. Viola Johnson (Tonye Patano), who planted the bugged clock in Weinberger's study, has been feeling increasingly guilty, and eventually confesses to the FBI. She tells Stan and Gaad what happened, and they surmise that Viola was threatened by the same couple who kidnapped Patterson.

How did the main character do what s/he did?\n\nStory: Zoila and Valentina welcome Genevieve home, having learned that, while out on her cruise, she managed to secure a new fiance: Alfred Pettigrove . He is 76 and rich, and Genevieve lied to him saying that she's 39. Zoila wonders if the man is stupid to think that this is her employer's real age, but then he enters the house, revealing himself to be blind. The maids aren't comfortable maintaining the lie over dinner, especially when Alfred announces that Genevieve has agreed to bear him a child, and Zoila asks her how that's supposed to work. Genevieve reveals that she'll pretend to find out she's barren and then adopt an orphan, but Zoila doesn't like the idea of a kid being brought into this.||||| Genevieve believes herself to be a wonderful mother, but this is only because nobody's told her that Remi is really in rehab, and Valentina stops her mother from doing so when she almost throws this in Genevieve's face.||||| Valentina assures that Alfred is smart and will figure out Genevieve's lies when he wants to, but Zoila accidentally spills the beans when she reveals that Genevieve's father died during the Korean war in the 50s, and Alfred demands to know his fiancee's real age. Once he does, he leaves her, and Zoila tries apologizing to her boss but points out that it's for the best because Genevieve was lying about being in love with him anyway. However, Genevieve assures that she liked Alfred for more than just his money, while Valentina tends to the old man as he prepares to move out. She gives her candid opinion that perhaps the reason that Alfred is so unwilling to forgive Genevieve is the reason that he's 76 and never been married, which gets Alfred thinking: he's willing to stay with Genevieve if they can use a surrogate to bear them a child... but he wants to use Valentina's eggs to make the baby.||||| Rosie meets with Marisol to learn the schematics of the Powell house before going to work there, with Marisol lying to the other maids and saying that Rosie is doing extra work with her over at the Stappords'. On Rosie's first day working for Evelyn , she brings Tucker Westmore with her; when Evelyn dozes off, Rosie takes the opportunity to sneak away and find the secret room, but this means that, when Tucker starts crying, nobody is around to soothe him except Evelyn.||||| When Rosie returns from the room, she finds her new employer cradling her other employer's child. The next day, Evelyn wishes to take Tucker to the park with her, and Rosie allows it while she once again investigates the secret room to watch through all the DVDs with Flora 's name on them. Marisol calls her to hear what she's learned, but all Rosie's seen is Flora's regular sessions, with no clue as to who killed her. It's then that she sees the time and realizes that Evelyn is still gone with the baby. She begins to panic, checking the park and knocking on doors, but Evelyn later returns after having taken Tucker shopping. Rosie is distraught and berates her new boss for what she did, at which Evelyn reminds her to watch her tone because she is her employee. However, Rosie states that she's not anymore, for she quits, to Evelyn's dismay.||||| Marisol returns home to find Taylor and Michael having sex atop the kitchen counter, to her shock. When she returns, she learns that her employers are actually trying for a baby, but Taylor has begun to worry that something is wrong with her because it's been months and still no baby. Marisol recommends a clinic that she herself used and, when they're there, she ends up accidentally revealing that, upon learning she was baron, she and her husband just adopted. This confuses Taylor because, when they first interviewed Marisol, she said she didn't have a family, and so Marisol fabricates that when she and her husband divorced she had to give the baby back, to Taylor's horror.||||| Taylor then runs into Joan Fisher , who is a friend of Olivia's , and only reveals to her that she and Michael are trying for a baby upon her assurance that she and Olivia have had a falling out. However, it seems that Joan was lying, for she proceeds to call Olivia and tell her all about what she saw. This time when Marisol returns home, she finds Olivia cooking pot roast in the kitchen, having heard that her ex-husband is trying to impregnate the whore he married. She recalls how Marisol said he was still in love with her and says how she's put her life on hold waiting for him to come back, but if Taylor gets pregnant then he'll be trapped forever. She demands reassurance that Michael indeed loves her, but Marisol is forced to admit that she lied, trying her best to apologize. Olivia says that it's not enough to say you're sorry when you've ruined someone's life, before storming out; Marisol feels horrible, and then she gets a text from Rosie saying that they need to talk.||||| Carmen is berated by Alejandro for ruining his sweater by putting it in the drier when it should have been dry-cleaned, but, when he's gone, Carmen confronts Odessa and tells her that they both know she wasn't the one who did it. When Odessa tries defending herself, Carmen smells alcohol on her breath, and in the night she is awoken by the sound of a bottle smashing. She discovers Odessa drinking Alejandro's good scotch, and now she's cut her hand; when she goes to get a first aid kit from Odessa's medical cabinet, she discovers cancer medication, now knowing that the reason her superior is drinking is to numb the pain of her disease.||||| When Alejandro finds the bottle broken, Carmen once again takes the blame and offers to clean it up; the next morning, Odessa discovers Carmen cleaning the silver, even though it's her job. She realizes that Carmen knows about the cancer and refuses to let her feel sorry for her, stating that she's not dead yet as she takes over the silver-polishing as always. Carmen knows from having seen her mother go through it that pain medication for cancer doesn't always work, and so she makes Odessa a brownie filled with medical marijuana. Carmen says that, while Odessa is right in thinking that she was only being nice to her because she was dying, she would like to know her. Odessa proceeds to reveal that she was once a great dancer before getting cancer in her leg and leaving Russia because she could not stand people feeling sorry for her. She and Carmen proceed to bond as she reads some of her old reviews.||||| The two undercover maids, Rosie and Marisol , proceed to meet up so that the former can reveal to the latter that she quit her job at the Powells'. Marisol is distraught because of how close they are to finding out who killed Flora , but Rosie doesn't like the way Evelyn acted with Tucker , having felt insane vibes from the woman. Marisol assures that Evelyn is fine, but Rosie senses that this is a lie, now being able to tell when Marisol is lying.||||| Marisol realizes that she's right; she says how she's been telling herself over and over that because she was trying to free Eddie then the ends justified the means, but now she's starting hurting people with her constant trickery and that's not right. Rosie later returns to Evelyn to get paid for the last of her work, and Evelyn gets her some money from the safe. As she does this, Rosie sees a DVD - Flora #10 - stashed away inside. Thinking this to be the one Marisol needs, she agrees to return as Evelyn's maid. She only saw the first two letters of the combination: BA; however, Marisol knows it to be BARRETT, since this is the name of someone Evelyn loved very very much.

At adjacent telephone booths in Grand Central Station, each calls family, then buys gifts for their spouses at Saks Fifth Avenue, and later visits friends. Over lunch, Frank's friend and colleague, Ed Lasky, reveals he is getting a divorce, and Molly learns that her friend, Isabelle, is going to Acapulco with her young boyfriend, David. In the evening, Frank and Molly shop at the bookstore, Rizzoli. As they leave the store with multiple shopping bags, their paths collide, when Molly realizes that Frank has mistakenly grabbed her package. Frank gives it to her, and they wish each other a Merry Christmas.||||| The next morning, Frank opens presents with his wife, Ann, and two sons, Mike and Joe, and after Ann unwraps The Big Book of Sailing, he is perplexed about what happened to the gardening book he bought her. Meanwhile, under Molly's Christmas tree, her husband Brian Gilmore, receives the gift, Gardens for All Seasons, and she is amused by the mix-up. Three months later on the Metro-North Commuter train, Frank notices Molly and attempts to figure out why she seems so familiar. As they disembark, Frank recalls that she is the woman from Rizzoli, and reminds her about dropping the Christmas packages. Molly says that she still has his book. In a nod to their previous meeting, they wish each other a Merry Christmas and go their separate ways. At work on a construction site in Manhattan, Frank's colleague, Victor Rawlins, encourages him to consider an opportunity in Houston, Texas, but Frank is reluctant to commit to the year-long job.||||| Molly visits her father, John Trainer, in the hospital, but has difficulty getting a straight answer from him about his health. Back at the construction site, Frank tells Ed about a woman he met on the train that morning, and meanwhile at Isabelle's office, while showing her latest illustrations, Molly mentions Frank. Despite their friends's goading, Molly and Frank downplay any significance; however, prior to boarding the train, Frank practices a dialogue he might have with Molly. On the train, Frank sees Molly looking for a seat and later approaches her standing near the door where they have an awkward conversation about being married and the curious fact of running into each other again. Tactfully, Frank suggests that they ride together tomorrow, and, Molly tells him that she plans to take the Friday, 9:04am train. That morning, Frank just makes the train, and Molly saves the seat next to her.||||| During the ride, he talks about his sons. Later that day, Frank arranges to meet Molly at the hospital and persuades her to have lunch, during which he does most of the talking. Although shy, Molly is engaged by his conversation and sense of humor. On another day, at a cafe in Grand Central Station, Molly speaks more openly, revealing that two years ago her newborn daughter died. Molly and Frank continue to get to know each during their commutes. Sometime later, while walking together in Manhattan, Isabelle suspects that Molly is seeing someone, based on her glowing appearance. Molly tries to explain that it is only a friendship, but her uneasiness indicates deeper feelings. Embarrassed, Molly abruptly walks away from Isabelle and telephones Frank. Molly and Frank spend that afternoon in Chinatown and have their picture taken together in an arcade photo booth. That evening during dinner with Brian, Molly appears preoccupied.||||| On another day, Molly hurries to the hospital to learn that her father had an arteriogram, and requires heart surgery. Molly is unable to reach her husband with the news, so she telephones Frank and goes to see him at the construction site. Frank recognizes that something is wrong. At first, Molly explains that her father is back in the hospital, but then proclaims, with ambivalence, that she has responsibilities and should not see Frank anymore. As she gets into a taxi, Frank asks her to wait for him at the station cafe at 5:45pm, prior to boarding the train. Delayed by work, Frank hurries to the station, only to miss the rendezvous. As the train pulls away, he turns around to see that Molly is waiting for him on the platform. He passionately kisses her and expresses his love. The next day, instead of taking his sons to a baseball game, Frank meets Molly at Rizzoli.||||| Despite their mutual doubts and anxiety, they go to Ed's empty apartment in Manhattan. They kiss, but as they move to the bed and begin to remove their clothes, Molly says she cannot continue and apologizes. They hold hands on the train home. At the Dobbs Ferry station, Molly watches from the train as Frank's wife and sons greet him. When she arrives home, Molly's husband says her father has died, and Frank learns the news when he tries to telephone Molly at the hospital. Overcome with grief and guilt, Molly becomes hysterical during the funeral, and her husband has a difficult time calming her. At home in bed, she relates to Isabelle that she cannot stop thinking about Frank, and that Brian assumes Molly is just distracted by the death of her father. Molly admits to Isabelle that she loves Frank and believes they are meant to be together even though she is resigned to the fact that they never will be.||||| While Ann fixes him dinner, Frank discusses the Houston job that he has finally accepted, but his wife senses that there is something else he is not telling her. Frank confesses that he met a woman on the train, but that it was only a friendship and nothing happened. Calmly, Ann says that she will take the kids to Denver for two weeks to see her mother, and then she slaps Frank. That evening, Frank drives to Molly's house and looks at it from his car. The night of his departure for Houston, he telephones Molly at home and says he misses her, asking if they can meet that evening.||||| Molly's husband enters the room, making it difficult for her to talk openly, so she says goodbye, wishing Frank a good trip. After she hangs up, her husband says, \"well, that's that,\" indicating he knows about Frank. Molly rushes out to catch Frank, despite Brian's pleading. Frank calls Molly again before getting in the taxi, but Brian answers, lying to Frank that Molly does not want to speak to him. In the pouring rain, Molly speeds along the road, slamming on brakes to avoid a train and stalling her car, thereby missing the opportunity to say goodbye. The following Christmas, Frank is visiting from Houston and meets Ed at a restaurant in Manhattan.||||| After Ed asks Frank to be the best man at his upcoming wedding, Frank reveals that he came back to arrange the sale of his house and that his marriage with Ann did not work out, so she returned to Denver. Meanwhile, Molly is also in Manhattan visiting with Isabelle, who encourages Molly to accept a job offer and insists that she should join her in Barbados, instead of spending Christmas alone. That evening, Frank enters Rizzoli and encounters Molly. During their polite but reserved exchange, Molly apologizes for not being able to say goodbye the night he left for Houston, and Frank says he should not have called. When asked about their families, neither discloses the state of their marriages. They wish each other a Merry Christmas and leave the bookstore, walking in opposite directions, but thinking about the other. Frank stops and runs down the sidewalk. At Grand Central Station, Molly boards the commuter train. During the journey, she sees Frank making his way towards her. They kiss, embrace, and stare into each other's eyes.\nPlease provide a list of main concepts mentioned in the above story using the 5 W's, 1 H retell strategy.", "original_narrative": "Molly Gilmore and Frank Raftis do not know each other, but they have parallel experiences as they take the Metro-North Commuter Railroad from Westchester County into Manhattan on the day before Christmas.

On another day, at a cafe in Grand Central Station, Molly speaks more openly, revealing that two years ago her newborn daughter died. Molly and Frank continue to get to know each during their commutes. Sometime later, while walking together in Manhattan, Isabelle suspects that Molly is seeing someone, based on her glowing appearance. Molly tries to explain that it is only a friendship, but her uneasiness indicates deeper feelings. Embarrassed, Molly abruptly walks away from Isabelle and telephones Frank. Molly and Frank spend that afternoon in Chinatown and have their picture taken together in an arcade photo booth. That evening during dinner with Brian, Molly appears preoccupied.||||| On another day, Molly hurries to the hospital to learn that her father had an arteriogram, and requires heart surgery. Molly is unable to reach her husband with the news, so she telephones Frank and goes to see him at the construction site. Frank recognizes that something is wrong. At first, Molly explains that her father is back in the hospital, but then proclaims, with ambivalence, that she has responsibilities and should not see Frank anymore. As she gets into a taxi, Frank asks her to wait for him at the station cafe at 5:45pm, prior to boarding the train. Delayed by work, Frank hurries to the station, only to miss the rendezvous. As the train pulls away, he turns around to see that Molly is waiting for him on the platform. He passionately kisses her and expresses his love. The next day, instead of taking his sons to a baseball game, Frank meets Molly at Rizzoli.||||| Despite their mutual doubts and anxiety, they go to Ed's empty apartment in Manhattan. They kiss, but as they move to the bed and begin to remove their clothes, Molly says she cannot continue and apologizes. They hold hands on the train home. At the Dobbs Ferry station, Molly watches from the train as Frank's wife and sons greet him. When she arrives home, Molly's husband says her father has died, and Frank learns the news when he tries to telephone Molly at the hospital. Overcome with grief and guilt, Molly becomes hysterical during the funeral, and her husband has a difficult time calming her. At home in bed, she relates to Isabelle that she cannot stop thinking about Frank, and that Brian assumes Molly is just distracted by the death of her father. Molly admits to Isabelle that she loves Frank and believes they are meant to be together even though she is resigned to the fact that they never will be.||||| While Ann fixes him dinner, Frank discusses the Houston job that he has finally accepted, but his wife senses that there is something else he is not telling her. Frank confesses that he met a woman on the train, but that it was only a friendship and nothing happened. Calmly, Ann says that she will take the kids to Denver for two weeks to see her mother, and then she slaps Frank. That evening, Frank drives to Molly's house and looks at it from his car. The night of his departure for Houston, he telephones Molly at home and says he misses her, asking if they can meet that evening.||||| Molly's husband enters the room, making it difficult for her to talk openly, so she says goodbye, wishing Frank a good trip. After she hangs up, her husband says, \"well, that's that,\" indicating he knows about Frank. Molly rushes out to catch Frank, despite Brian's pleading. Frank calls Molly again before getting in the taxi, but Brian answers, lying to Frank that Molly does not want to speak to him. In the pouring rain, Molly speeds along the road, slamming on brakes to avoid a train and stalling her car, thereby missing the opportunity to say goodbye. The following Christmas, Frank is visiting from Houston and meets Ed at a restaurant in Manhattan.||||| After Ed asks Frank to be the best man at his upcoming wedding, Frank reveals that he came back to arrange the sale of his house and that his marriage with Ann did not work out, so she returned to Denver. Meanwhile, Molly is also in Manhattan visiting with Isabelle, who encourages Molly to accept a job offer and insists that she should join her in Barbados, instead of spending Christmas alone. That evening, Frank enters Rizzoli and encounters Molly. During their polite but reserved exchange, Molly apologizes for not being able to say goodbye the night he left for Houston, and Frank says he should not have called. When asked about their families, neither discloses the state of their marriages. They wish each other a Merry Christmas and leave the bookstore, walking in opposite directions, but thinking about the other. Frank stops and runs down the sidewalk. At Grand Central Station, Molly boards the commuter train. During the journey, she sees Frank making his way towards her. They kiss, embrace, and stare into each other's eyes.", "row": 29, "response": "Here are the main concepts mentioned in the story using the 5 W's, 1 H retell strategy:\n\n**Who:**\n\n* Molly Gilmore\n* Frank Raftis\n* Ann (Frank's wife)\n* Brian Gilmore (Molly's husband)\n* Ed Lasky (Frank's friend and colleague)\n* Isabelle (Molly's friend)\n* John Trainer (Molly's father)\n* Mike and Joe (Frank's sons)\n* Victor Rawlins (Frank's colleague)\n\n**What:**\n\n* Molly and Frank's parallel experiences on the day before Christmas\n* Their chance encounters and conversations on the train and in Manhattan\n* Molly's struggles with her father's health and her own feelings of guilt and grief\n* Frank's decision to take a job in Houston and his subsequent return to New York\n* The development of Molly and Frank's friendship and romance\n\n**When:**\n\n* The day before Christmas\n* Three months later\n* Several months after their initial meeting\n* The day of Molly's father's heart surgery\n* The day Frank leaves for Houston\n* The following Christmas\n\n**Where:**\n\n* Grand Central Station\n* Manhattan\n* Westchester County\n* Houston, Texas\n* Acapulco\n* Barbados\n* Denver\n* Dobbs Ferry station\n* Rizzoli bookstore\n* Chinatown\n* A construction site in Manhattan\n* A hospital\n* A cafe in Grand Central Station\n\n**Why:**\n\n* Molly and Frank's desire for human connection and friendship\n* Molly's need for emotional support during her father's illness\n* Frank's sense of restlessness and dissatisfaction with his marriage\n* Molly's feelings of guilt and grief after her father's death\n* Frank's decision to pursue a relationship with Molly despite being married\n\n**How:**\n\n* Through chance encounters and conversations on the train and in Manhattan\n* Through their shared experiences and emotional connections\n* Through Frank's persistence and Molly's growing feelings for him\n* Through their eventual decision to pursue a romantic relationship despite the obstacles in their way", "decomposed_mcs": ["Molly Gilmore", "Frank Raftis", "Ann", "Brian Gilmore", "Ed Lasky", "Isabelle", "John Trainer", "Mike and Joe", "Victor Rawlins", "Molly and Frank's parallel experiences on the day before Christmas", "Their chance encounters occurred on the train.", "Their chance encounters occurred in Manhattan.", "Their conversations occurred on the train.", "Their conversations occurred in Manhattan.", "Molly's struggles with her father's health.", "Molly's struggles with her own feelings of guilt and grief.", "Frank decided to take a job in Houston.", "Frank returned to New York.", "The development of Molly and Frank's friendship and romance", "The day before Christmas", "Three months later", "Several months after their initial meeting", "The day of Molly's father's heart surgery", "The day Frank leaves for Houston", "The following Christmas", "Grand Central Station", "Manhattan", "Westchester County", "Houston Texas", "Acapulco", "Barbados", "Denver", "Dobbs Ferry station", "Rizzoli bookstore", "Chinatown", "A construction site is in Manhattan.", "A hospital", "A cafe is in Grand Central Station.", "Molly and Frank's desire for human connection and friendship", "Molly's need for emotional support during her father's illness", "Frank has a sense of restlessness.", "Frank has dissatisfaction with his marriage.", "Molly's feelings of guilt and grief after her father's death", "Frank's decision was to pursue a relationship with Molly.", "Frank was married.", "Through chance encounters and conversations on the train and in Manhattan.", "Through their shared experiences and emotional connections", "Frank had persistence.", "Molly had growing feelings for him.", "They decided to pursue a romantic relationship.", "They decided to pursue a romantic relationship despite the obstacles in their way."]}

He asks Stefan if he is still working with Klaus to which Stefan replies by telling Damon about the breakup with Elena. Damon doesn't react and changes the subject by telling Stefan that to get to the cure, the hunter's map needs to be completed by killing enough vampires. He suggests that they find another hunter unless they want Jeremy to follow in Connor's footsteps. He also tells Stefan that he thought of going to Prof. Shane but there is something fishy.

Tyler does not want to go to the event, but Hayley convinces him to take her. Jeremy had a nightmare about killing Elena and wakes up with a knife and a stake in his hand. He later tells Matt that he doesn't know how it got there and maybe he is going crazy like Alaric . Matt tells him it must be because he is a hunter and that if Jeremy doesn't tell Elena, he will.

Caroline cannot understand why Elena suddenly changed her mind. Elena goes after Damon and tells him that they need to talk. He tells her he knows about the break-up but does not know the reason. Elena answers in a single word \"you\". Before Damon has a chance to react they are interrupted by Prof. Shane and Damon leaves with him reluctantly. He asks Prof.||||| Shane for the name of another hunter. When the Prof. says he cannot help, Damon asks him why he is here and about his phone calls to the pastor the day the council was blown up. The Prof. doesn't answer and leaves. Matt tells Elena about Jeremy's nightmares. The pageant starts. Jeremy is missing so Matt steps in for him as April's escort. During the dance, Damon & Elena share a look remembering their dance the year before. Jeremy is at the Lockwood cellar, where Stefan bites his hand and feeds his blood to the convict, turning the convict in to a vampire. He asks Jeremy to kill the vampire and Jeremy does.

Klaus steps in and takes Caroline away for a drink. Caroline is wondering what is wrong with Elena and Klaus says she'll figure it out. They sit on a bench alone and share a cute moment. Tyler is looking at them from afar and is jealous. Damon later notices Prof. Shane & Hayley sharing a drink and asks Tyler to find out what is going on. Jeremy arms himself with stakes and goes to look for Elena. He meets April on the way & tells her that her father & the council were doing good for the town and that they died heroes.||||| Elena dances with Damon\n\nDamon corners Prof. Shane to ask for another hunter's name again & threatens to kill him. Prof. tells him that even if they get the map & the cure, the cure has to be opened by a spell by a Bennett witch and Damon needs him alive to get Bonnie's powers back. Damon lets him go. April is crowned Miss Mystic Falls. Meanwhile, Elena follows Jeremy in to a room where they fight and he attacks her with a stake in the neck.||||| She is rescued by Stefan & Matt who takes Jeremy away. Tyler and Hayley share a drink and he asks her if she knows Prof. Shane. She denies knowing him. They see Caroline & Klaus share another sweet moment. Hayley is working with Shane\n\nStefan tells Elena it's his fault that Jeremy is feeling this growing urge to kill vampires. He confesses he has asked Jeremy to kill vampires and this angers Elena. She says she doesn't want the cure at the cost of Jeremy's humanity. Stefan tells her they need to fix things to which she tells him that the old Elena died in the accident and he needs to accept that she has changed and needs to let go. Stefan sees Damon walking towards them and leaves.||||| Stefan and Caroline discovers Elena is sired to Damon\n\nJeremy is packing to leave when Matt comes & tells him he is moving in with him to keep the hunter thing in check. Elena has moved out. She is shown at the Salvatore house. Stefan asks her to pick a room and leaves to crash someplace else for the night, leaving Damon & Elena alone at home. Kim, the hybrid, has broken the sire bond and Tyler texts Hayley to tell her. She is shown talking to Prof. Shane telling him that another sire bond is broken and asks him to leave Tyler out when things go down. Hayley is revealed to be secretly working with Shane and that he wants all the hybrids free from their sire bonds for what's to come.||||| Damon and Elena share a drink and she tells him that she wanted to dance with him today. He asks her for a dance - they slow dance and kiss. After this they have sex. Damon and Elena\n\nStefan and Caroline are talking about how things are with Elena and Caroline asks Stefan not to give up. They talk about the cure and Caroline wonders why Klaus needs it. When Stefan mentions that Klaus needs the cure for Elena to be human again to sire more hybrids, it strikes Caroline why Elena has been listening to everything Damon says. They deduce that because Damon told Elena that she could not drink from anywhere but the vein, she has been rejecting all other blood sources. They realize Elena killed Connor because Damon asked her to and that she is agreeing to everything Damon says because she is sired to him. It was his blood that created her as a vampire.

She is reluctant till he reminds her that she promised him a date in return of his hybrid. She gives in. Hayley is trying to get another one of Klaus's hybrids, Kim , to turn and break the sire bond when Tyler comes to tell her that Caroline has bought them one more day by keeping Klaus busy at the event. Tyler does not want to go to the event, but Hayley convinces him to take her. Jeremy had a nightmare about killing Elena and wakes up with a knife and a stake in his hand. He later tells Matt that he doesn't know how it got there and maybe he is going crazy like Alaric . Matt tells him it must be because he is a hunter and that if Jeremy doesn't tell Elena, he will. He gets a message from Stefan to come to the Lockwood cellar and tell no one about it and so he leaves.||||| Damon and Elena\n\nElena and Caroline are helping April choose her dress for the pageant. They tell her to wear the blue while Damon arrives asking for Prof. Shane and tells April to wear the red dress. Caroline disagrees. Damon asks Elena and she changes her opinion to say red. Caroline cannot understand why Elena suddenly changed her mind. Elena goes after Damon and tells him that they need to talk. He tells her he knows about the break-up but does not know the reason. Elena answers in a single word \"you\". Before Damon has a chance to react they are interrupted by Prof. Shane and Damon leaves with him reluctantly. He asks Prof.||||| Shane for the name of another hunter. When the Prof. says he cannot help, Damon asks him why he is here and about his phone calls to the pastor the day the council was blown up. The Prof. doesn't answer and leaves. Matt tells Elena about Jeremy's nightmares. The pageant starts. Jeremy is missing so Matt steps in for him as April's escort. During the dance, Damon & Elena share a look remembering their dance the year before. Jeremy is at the Lockwood cellar, where Stefan bites his hand and feeds his blood to the convict, turning the convict in to a vampire. He asks Jeremy to kill the vampire and Jeremy does. He tries to compel Jeremy to tell him how much the hunter's mark has grown, but Jeremy refuses to tell him and stakes him in the stomach saying he can no longer be compelled.||||| Stefan saves Elena from Jeremy\n\nElena & Caroline are worried about Jeremy when Damon arrives. Elena tells them about Jeremy's nightmares. Damon asks her not worry and let it go while he goes to find Jeremy. Damon calls Stefan to confirm if he took Jeremy to kill vampires & asks him to leave it alone. Caroline is angry with Elena for listening to Damon and they have a fight. Klaus steps in and takes Caroline away for a drink. Caroline is wondering what is wrong with Elena and Klaus says she'll figure it out. They sit on a bench alone and share a cute moment. Tyler is looking at them from afar and is jealous. Damon later notices Prof. Shane & Hayley sharing a drink and asks Tyler to find out what is going on. Jeremy arms himself with stakes and goes to look for Elena. He meets April on the way & tells her that her father & the council were doing good for the town and that they died heroes.||||| Elena dances with Damon\n\nDamon corners Prof. Shane to ask for another hunter's name again & threatens to kill him. Prof. tells him that even if they get the map & the cure, the cure has to be opened by a spell by a Bennett witch and Damon needs him alive to get Bonnie's powers back. Damon lets him go. April is crowned Miss Mystic Falls. Meanwhile, Elena follows Jeremy in to a room where they fight and he attacks her with a stake in the neck.||||| She is rescued by Stefan & Matt who takes Jeremy away. Tyler and Hayley share a drink and he asks her if she knows Prof. Shane. She denies knowing him. They see Caroline & Klaus share another sweet moment. Hayley is working with Shane\n\nStefan tells Elena it's his fault that Jeremy is feeling this growing urge to kill vampires. He confesses he has asked Jeremy to kill vampires and this angers Elena. She says she doesn't want the cure at the cost of Jeremy's humanity. Stefan tells her they need to fix things to which she tells him that the old Elena died in the accident and he needs to accept that she has changed and needs to let go. Stefan sees Damon walking towards them and leaves.||||| Stefan and Caroline discovers Elena is sired to Damon\n\nJeremy is packing to leave when Matt comes & tells him he is moving in with him to keep the hunter thing in check. Elena has moved out. She is shown at the Salvatore house. Stefan asks her to pick a room and leaves to crash someplace else for the night, leaving Damon & Elena alone at home. Kim, the hybrid, has broken the sire bond and Tyler texts Hayley to tell her. She is shown talking to Prof. Shane telling him that another sire bond is broken and asks him to leave Tyler out when things go down. Hayley is revealed to be secretly working with Shane and that he wants all the hybrids free from their sire bonds for what's to come.||||| Damon and Elena share a drink and she tells him that she wanted to dance with him today. He asks her for a dance - they slow dance and kiss. After this they have sex. Damon and Elena\n\nStefan and Caroline are talking about how things are with Elena and Caroline asks Stefan not to give up. They talk about the cure and Caroline wonders why Klaus needs it. When Stefan mentions that Klaus needs the cure for Elena to be human again to sire more hybrids, it strikes Caroline why Elena has been listening to everything Damon says. They deduce that because Damon told Elena that she could not drink from anywhere but the vein, she has been rejecting all other blood sources. They realize Elena killed Connor because Damon asked her to and that she is agreeing to everything Damon says because she is sired to him. It was his blood that created her as a vampire.

Within the Dream World, Lavi is surrounded by illusions of the dead bodies of his friends. He finds Lenalee and begs her to wake up and is then confronted by his previous alias, Deak, who says she is nothing more than a tiny piece of history.||||| He is also reminded by Bookman that those of the Bookman Clan only exist on the sidelines of the world and must observe with unbiased eyes. Deak goes on to warn Lavi that he should not let his heart distract him and interfere with his recording of history. Lavi, however, realises that the whole thing is an illusion and that he needs to get out of there. Meanwhile, despite her injured legs, Lenalee tries to get out of Road's barrier by kicking it over and over again. She eventually becomes exhausted, but Chaozii, having seen her determination begins to punch the barrier in an attempt to break it down. Lenalee tries to stop him but he does not listen, even when his fist begins to bleed. Unsurprisingly, he is unable to break down the barrier and despairs at his lack of power.||||| As this happens, Road and Tyki look to Allen in shock when they see that he has produced a sword from his left arm. Allen is determined to get out of there by using his new power, managing to push back a surprised Tyki, who begins to worry he has awakened something terrible. Road also expresses shock upon seeing the sword, which she remembers as one the Millennium Earl once held. Even Lenalee becomes concerned about the large amount of power coming from Allen. With this, Allen continues his fight with Tyki, asking him is there is anyone in the world he would want to protect. This makes Tyki think back to his human friends, especially Eeez , who he often gave gifts of small, precious stones and the silver buttons from the exorcist uniforms. Road reveals that she knows why he always takes the silver buttons from the slayed exorcists' uniforms and tells Tyki that he seems to be getting too friendly with the humans he hangs out with.||||| Despite thinking about the group of humans he cares for, Tyki maintains that there are times when the people he wants to protect do not matter - he greatly enjoys killing and destroying. At that moment, Allen strikes him with his Sword of Exorcism, and although Tyki felt the pain, he realises it did not kill him like he thought it would. Tyki is not completely unharmed, however, as it is revealed by Allen that he did not strike his body, but his Noah memories. When Allen prepares to deal the finishing blow to Tyki's Noah memories, Road leaps into action but Tyki stops her. He thinks about what it would be like if one of the sides of him were to disappear - he considers it will actually make life easier, but concludes that it would probably be boring. He stands, and allows Allen to stab him, apologising to Road. He again thinks of Eeez before he passes out.||||| While Chaozii celebrates their win, Road becomes enraged and stabs him with her sharpened candles. She then summons more of the candles to surround Allen, Lenalee and Chaozii, and although she realises that they would probably do no harm to Allen, the others would surely die if they were struck. Road heads to Tyki's body and holds him, warning Allen that she feels a little hot-headed because of what happened. She wishes to punish his friends for what happened, promising to rip Lavi's heart to shreds. Back in the dream world, Lavi is surrounded by the illusions of his friends' reanimated corpses. He is again confronted by Bookman who asks him what the duty of the Bookman Clan is. At that moment, Lenalee awakens in Lavi's arms and attempts to stab him, though Lavi manages to jump back in time. She asks him why he has abandoned his friends, and tells him that they are not just ink on paper. With this, all of his friends begin to attack him.

Olivia Dunham and Phillip Broyles discuss locating William Bell for questioning, whom they believe is behind all the fringe events that have been occurring all season. Meanwhile, Walter Bishop is at a graveyard, where he solemnly stares at an unknown gravestone. Olivia, Peter Bishop , and Astrid Farnsworth begin searching for Walter. Nina tells Olivia that an energy cell was stolen from her mechanical arm by Jones, and that he was formerly a Massive Dynamic employee who had looked up to Bell as a \"father figure\" until they had a falling out. When Olivia demands to speak to Bell, Nina explains that she does not know where he is, as Bell has been communicating these past few months \"strictly electronically\". Nina believes Jones is trying to confront Bell, and promises Olivia that if she stops Jones, Nina will arrange a meeting between her and Bell.||||| On a busy New York City street, Jones and his team use the energy cell to open a doorway into the Alternate Universe and bring a truck through, but are apparently unsuccessful, as Jones complains he used the \"wrong coordinates\". Having previously observed Walter at the graveyard, The Observer arrives with Walter at the Bishops' beach house, and gives Walter a coin, telling him to remember what he has to find. Walter goes on alone into the house, while Olivia and Charlie interview witnesses who saw Jones extract the truck from the doorway.||||| They discover that the truck's VIN numbers do not exist, which implies the \"truck was never made\". A further interview with Nina reveals to the Fringe team that the truck is from another universe, and that Jones is using the stolen energy cell to travel to that universe. Peter finds Walter and chooses to meet his father alone, as he believes Walter is upset from the past several days. Now at the beach house, Peter and Walter search for and retrieve a device that can seal shut the doorway into the other universe. Walter explains to Peter that he once lost something very dear to him and that he had to go and bring it back from another reality; the device was created to prevent something from following him.||||| After Jones makes another unsuccessful attempt to open a doorway at a soccer field in Providence, Olivia searches through old case files related to science and unexplained phenomena, and discovers the connection between the soccer field and the city street. Olivia and Walter come to the same conclusion, that Jones is going to use a site at Reiden Lake to reopen the doorway. Olivia, Peter, and Walter intercept Jones while he is opening another window and is halfway through it. Peter triggers Walter's device, killing Jones by sealing the doorway.||||| At the end of the episode, Walter again goes alone to visit the graveyard; he tearfully observes a gravestone marked \"Peter Bishop 1978-1985\", suggesting that Walter's legitimate son died. Nina Sharp later calls Olivia and implies to her that she can meet William Bell in Manhattan. After no one shows up at the agreed-upon restaurant, Olivia leaves, as she assumes that she got stood up.

The brothers haven't spoken since Damon left Stefan on the train platform in WWII. Joe stabs Damon with a vervain needle, saying the money was too good to pass up. Damon manages to stab Joe in the neck with his broken glass before he drops. Another man comes in and says he'll be Damon's doctor from now on. In the present, Damon wakes up in a cell with Wes Maxfield injecting him with vervain. He tells Damon that because he killed his test subject last night (Jesse), Damon's going to take his place. Elena takes Aaron's help to find Damon At college, Elena drops in on Aaron, who is reeling over the death of his roommate, Jesse.||||| Even though Elena killed him, she pretends to be shocked. Aaron is overwhelmed by the fact that someone else close to him died. She asks about Wes, who became his legal guardian after his aunt Sarah died. She tells Aaron that Damon went to talk to Wes last night and no one has seen either of them since. She asks for his help finding Wes. Aaron thinks he knows a place. Elena asks Aaron if he thinks it's weird that both his friends committed suicide in their first semester. Elena tells Aaron that Wes covered up Megan's murder. Aaron wants to find Wes to ask him about it. He takes Elena to the Whitmore House, which she knows she can't enter. But Wes invites her in and she's able to enter. He confesses that he owns the house as part of the Whitmore Trust he inherited when his parents died. His name's Aaron Whitmore. Elena looks at a picture and recognizes her father. Wes joins them, and says Grayson Gilbert was one of the best doctors the Augustines ever had. Then he injects Elena with vervain.||||| Caroline makes Stefan go inside the safe to overcome his PTSD At the house, Stefan keeps watch over Katherine, trying to ensure she doesn't kill herself. She's pouty and angry about his hovering and thinks he can't help her until he deals with his own PTSD. She called in help. Caroline arrives as his sober coach--with a giant safe. Stefan questions whether the safe is a good idea for coping with his PTSD. Caroline reads up on PTSD while Stefan is in the safe. She's oblivious as Stefan starts to freak out inside.

Flash back to 1953, Whitmore has Damon strapped to a table. He plans to experiment on him, knowing that as a vampire he'll heal from all his wounds. He plans to cut out parts of Damon's internal organs so he'll regrow them. To begin, he stabs Damon in the eye. Maxfield tells Damon that after training Jesse to crave vampire blood, he's ready to take his research to his next level. Aaron struggles to understand what Wes is doing. Wes tells him vampires exist and Elena is one of them. He opens his safe to reveal stacks of Whitmore files. Wes explains to Aaron that his father taught him everything he knows about vampires and research and the Whitmore Trust has been funding his research. He tells Aaron it's his legacy.||||| Wes captures Elena too\n\nElena wakes up in a cell next to Damon. Damon confesses he's been there before and tells her about Whitmore's torture, including cutting up pieces of them every day. He was there for about five years. He made a friend, Enzo, a soldier in Europe during WWII, who was also a vampire. Whitmore was working in a battlefield hospital overseas when he discovered Enzo was a vampire and locked him in a coffin and shipped him overseas. He'd been locked up ten years. Enzo tried to teach Damon how to survive, including picturing exactly how he'd get his revenge. Elena tells Damon that her dad worked with Whitmore and was an Augustine. She doesn't want to believe he'd be part of a place that would cut Damon's eyes out. Damon tells Elena about his friend Enzo who was also tortured along with him\n\n1953 Enzo keeps Damon going by talking to him about a girl named Maggie that he liked.||||| Whitmore interrupts, asking who's next. He goes for Damon, but Enzo volunteers. Damon listens to him scream from in his cell until he's finally brought back in a bloody heap. Damon asks Whitmore why he's doing this and he explains he's trying to understand vampires on a cellular level to make use of them. Back in the present, Elena thinks Stefan will figure it out and come rescue them, but Damon never told him he was locked up--he didn't want to give him more to feel guilty about. Damon explains how he escaped.||||| They let the vampires out once a year for the Augustine's New Year's Eve party to show them off. They were weak from vervain and captivity. Whitmore demonstrates vampire blood's healing powers, using Mrs. Fell as a volunteer. She drinks vampire blood to heal her hand after he cuts it. Enzo comes up with a plan, suggesting one of them drink both of their daily rations of blood for a year so that when they're let out next New Year's Eve, one of them will have the strength to fight. They play rock paper scissors and Damon wins. Elena wants to know what happened, but Damon is not forthcoming with the details, saying only that it wasn't pretty.||||| Aaron learns that his family was killed by a vampire\n\nWes gives Aaron his grandfather's watch, which he says is a precaution against vampires. Aaron sees news clips about his parents' death at a campground. Wes admits they were killed by vampires. Aaron decks Wes, knocking him to the ground.

She also knows he wants to keep her alive, so she's counting on him not hurting her.||||| Damon turns off his humanity as he leaves Enzo to die in the fire\n\nDown in the cell, Elena prods Damon to tell her how he escaped. In 1958, he'd been drinking Enzo's rations for a year and he'd gotten stronger. When Whitmore opened the cage to take Damon out to show him off to the guests on New Year's, Damon broke his own hand to slip out of the chains. He gouged Whitmore's eyes out, then attacked as many people as he could in the room, knocking over a candelabra as he went. The fire raged with Enzo still in the cage. Damon tried to free him, but the bars were coated in vervain and the fire was advancing. Finally, he chose to save himself, but he turned off his emotions first so he could leave Enzo behind. He left Enzo there to die in the fire.||||| Caroline hugs Stefan after he is successful in dealing with his PTSD\n\nBack at the house, in the safe Stefan hyperventilates, saying he feels like he's dying. Katherine tells Stefan she believes there is something to the doppelganger prophecy and Stefan wants to get far away from Damon and Elena and she's just the latest excuse to stay in town. Stefan starts choking her. She tells him she thinks he's choosing to focus on the physical pain of drowning in the safe instead of the emotional pain of Elena breaking his heart. She turns to offer Stefan her neck and urges him to fight it. She promises she's there with him.||||| They are dangerously close to kissing when Caroline opens the safe, worried about how quiet it got. Out of the safe, Stefan seems to look at Katherine differently. Aaron shoots Damon after he confesses that he was the one who killed Aaron's family\n\nAaron comes down to the cells in the basement with his gun. He accuses Elena of killing Megan and possibly of killing his parents. Damon stops him, and says it was him. Damon explains that with Enzo dead, he had to carry out his revenge plan himself.

At FBI HQ in Boston Charlie ( Kirk Acevedo ), Broyles ( Lance Reddick ) and Olivia ( Anna Torv ) watch the security footage from Nina's building. There are three of them, wearing masks. They shoot her in the elevator then the tape cuts out for four minutes. They try to match the voice. David Robert Jones ( Jared Harris ), the ZFT mastermind. He says \"take out the camera, we can do it here.\" Olivia wants to bring William Bell ( Leonard Nimoy ) in. Broyles gently chastises her for assuming he doesn't agree. He's on board. Nina Sharp is out of surgery. Peter ( Joshua Jackson ) comes in to the lab. Walter ( John Noble ) didn't come home last night. Peter calls someone about Walter. Astrid ( Jasika Nicole ) can't find him either. Peter tells Olivia he understands why she had to say what she did. He's not worried about him.||||| Walter visits a grave, The Observer ( Michael Cerveris ) watches. Nina wakes up. Her electronic hand is on the fritz. Broyles is at her bedside. He asks her what Jones wanted with her arm. Nina asks for Olivia. Jones walks down a street carrying a briefcase, face partially bandaged. Olivia comes to Nina's room where specialists from Massive Dynamic are working on her. Jones and his crew start setting something up in the middle of a busy street. Nina tells Olivia that Jones worked for Bell 15 years ago but Bell isn't a terrorist. She says Jones was fired and was bitter about it since William was a father figure to him. She said after Jones busted out of prison he started calling for Bell a lot. Broyles tells Olivia that Nina thinks Jones wants to kill Bell. But she doesn't know where he is. She hasn't seen Bell for months. She thinks speaking to Bell has become more than a professional matter. She's counting on it. If Olivia can get to Jones first, she can talk to Bell.||||| Olivia asks what Jones did to Nina in the elevator after she was shot. Holding her bionic arm, she says Jones stole a very powerful energy cell Bell hid there. Jones delicately takes a small object out of a case and fits it into his machine. Through his bandages his face is bubbly and gross. The machine starts emitting a high pitched whine. People on the street start holding their ears. They increase the frequency. As Jones turns some knobs a whirring energy field appears in the street, like some sort of wormhole. Jones' men tell him they can't hold it open and it shuts, cutting off the back half of a truck that passed through. Jones says they're the wrong coordinates and they need to try again. When he removes his sunglasses we can see one of his eyes is now blue. Walter and The Observer walk along a beach. The Observer asks Walter if he recognizes a coin he's holding. Walter asks him how he got it. He says it looks similar to one Walter is thinking of, but it's different. \"There's more than one of everything,\" he says.||||| He asks him if the house they're in front of looks familiar and if he remembers what he has to find. He says there isn't much time. At Harvard, Broyles brings Nina into the lab. They ask her if Walter talked to anyone strange lately. Nina tells Peter that Jones has something Walter might know about. Nina calls someone for a search of Walter. Olivia and Charlie check out the half truck. Witnesses describe a curtain or window with a sheen that the truck came through. They describe a man in bandages. Nina shows Peter train security footage of his dad near a beach house they used to own. Peter wants to go up there himself. At the truck, Charlie gets a report the VIN and serial numbers don't exist and there's no record of it anywhere. Peter reaches the beach house. He looks around inside and finds Walter sitting by himself. He says he's looking for something. He's turning the coin over and over. He knows what he's looking for is important, but he can't remember what it is.||||| Olivia asks Nina where the truck came from. She asks where Bell is. She tells Nina to stop playing games or she'll turn this world over looking for him. Nina says that's the problem, he's not in this world. Providence, Rhode Island A black van pulls up to a kid's soccer game. Jones gets out. OIivia tries to talk Charlie through the idea Bell is in an alternate reality. That's why they can't ID the truck. It came from the other side. That's what Jones is using the energy cell for, to cross over to get to Bell. Their cell phones all ring. Walter searches frantically through the house, on the verge of a breakdown. Peter tries to calm him down, but he rails and thrashes and keeps searching. Peter tells his dad about fond memories of coming to the house as a kid, including Walter making pancakes. Walter gets excited when he remembers. He knows why he's there and where it is.||||| At the soccer field a kid describes a see-through wall that appeared, like a window. A kid ran into the shimmer and collapsed. They look at the body - it's cleanly sliced off. Charlie is ready to start buying the alternate reality theory. Olivia asks someone to run a check for all files mentioning science, biology or unexplained phenomena. All of them. She starts marking them on a map of New England with pushpins. She tells Broyles she thinks she found a connection and they need to call Nina. Walter opens a trunk in the beach house attic. He finds the box he was looking for with a coin just like the one The Observer gave him on top. It's a small tackle box, but it's locked. Olivia goes over the dots with Nina and Broyles. She marks the spots where Jones used his device. The other locations radiate out from them.||||| Walter opens the box and takes out a small object. He says when he and William were young they took copious amounts of LSD and became convinced they could experience alternate realities and some kids could see these alternate realities naturally. They theorized the subjects might be able to travel to alternate worlds. Around this time, Walter says, he lost something very dear to him. He thought he could find it over there. Nina explains finding the right place to cross over is the key. Bell proposed our world has \"soft spots,\" areas where the speed of light and protons have begun to decay, like the Bermuda Triangle, where it is easier to cross over. Their meddling with the laws of nature has increased the soft spots. She thinks Jones is looking for those. Walter continues the explanation, saying opening the hole could let things from there cross over to here, which could be dangerous. He built a plug, a patch to close the hole. That's what the object is. And he knows where the hole is: Reiden Lake.||||| Nina and Olivia want to try to predict the next soft spot. They trace the oldest incidents back to Reiden Lake. Jones and his men arrive at Reiden Lake. He tells them to set up the gear. \"Come on, men, we're going to the other side,\" he says. Peter drives Walter to the lake. Walter says they have to hurry, but he doesn't know why. He mentions his friend who visited him. Peter realizes he's talking about The Observer, the man who attacked him in the woods. Walter says Peter probably doesn't remember, but when he was very sick as a kid he began collecting coins to calm himself. He gives Peter the one he's been holding and says it was the coin. Peter doesn't remember it. Suddenly, their doors are opened and men grab them out of the car. Olivia runs over and calls off her agents. They're all there to plug a hole in the universe.||||| They see a bright light in the distance and run for it. Jones has got the machine going. He stays focused on it as his side starts trading gunfire with FBI agents. Walter gives Peter the patch to close the hole as Olivia creeps closer to Jones and the slowly opening universe hole. The hole opens up and Jones walks towards it. She shoots him. He keeps going. She shoots him again. He walks on. Looking oozy and gross, he tells her the teleporter may be killing him, but in the meantime it's made him something special. Bullets pass through him. He walks toward the opening. Olivia runs after him and Peter, holding the patch, runs after her. As Jones steps into the hole, Peter aims the patch at it, emitting a light. The hole closes shut, shearing Jones in half. Back at HQ Broyles tells OIivia that Nina sends her gratitude, but they've been told to cease and desist their investigation into William Bell.||||| Astrid arrives at the lab. She and Peter find a note, addressed to him. He reads it: \"Stepping out for a bit, don't worry about me, son, I know where I'm going.\" Peter tells Astrid not to call the police. It's the first time Walter's left a note. Walter stands back at the grave he visited earlier. He leaves the coin on it. It says: \"Peter Bishop, 1978-1985.\" Walter cries. Olivia's phone rings. It's Nina Sharp, summoning her to a hotel in Manhattan, planning to hold up her end of the bargain.||||| On her way there, through the city, Olivia is nearly hit by a speeding car.

Dawn asks Buffy why it is called a \"CAT Scan\" (do they test it on cats, or does the machine look like a cat?). Back at The Magic Box, Giles and Tara admire the new phone book advertisement for the magic shop while Anya is disappointed that she is not personally mentioned. Xander complains about Riley destroying the vampire crypt alone in the previous episode, and then the entire gang continues their search for information regarding the Beast. Giles agrees that it was reckless on Riley's part, while Anya expresses relief that the task was already completed, because she really hadn't wanted to start her day off with a slaughter (which, she notes, \"just goes to show how much I've grown!\").||||| In Glory's luxurious headquarters, a demon named Dreg offers a spell to Glory, groveling before her as she tries on elegant shoes, debating on whether they make her ankles look bony. Dreg promises that this spell will allow Glory to find the Key. She just needs some supplies, and she finds the advertisement for The Magic Box in the new phone book. Riley finds the front door to Buffy's house open, a blanket on the steps, and Spike in Buffy's room, sniffing her clothes. Spike declares that Buffy wouldn't care that he was in her room, and that the clothes-sniffing was just normal predator activity. Riley responds, \"Yeah, what's a little sweater-sniffing between sworn enemies?\" and drags him out and down the stairs, but not before Spike grabs a pair of Buffy's underwear.||||| Spike taunts Riley with his knowledge about Buffy's mother going to the hospital (which Buffy had failed to mention to Riley), as well as the time he and Buffy had spent together the previous evening eating, drinking, and talking. Spike insinuates Riley cannot keep Buffy satisfied, and Riley tells him to stay away from Buffy and throws him out into the sunlight, with his blanket. Riley shows up at the hospital to comfort Buffy, who seems relieved to see him. She directs him to sit with Dawn in the waiting room while she talks to their mother. Joyce confesses to Buffy that the doctors have found a \"shadow\" in her CAT scan, and they need to do an initial operation to evaluate her condition, and to discover whether surgery is an option. At The Magic Box, the Scoobies continue to search for information that might indicate the origins, purpose, or weaknesses of Glory.||||| Tara suggests that maybe the Beast is something that is too old for the books, which Giles believes may explain the presence of the Dagon Sphere, which is to ward against that \"which cannot be named.\" They discuss the possibility that Glory may predate language itself, when she herself shows up there and buys several items for a spell. The gang is, of course, oblivious to her true identity, and she leaves the store without incident. Back at the hospital, the doctor tells Buffy her mother has a brain tumor and presents her with her mother's options. Ben, an intern, gets the doctor away from Buffy, giving her a break from the doctor's constant questions. Riley takes Dawn to the park, where he tries to comfort her about her mother.||||| Dawn tries to make Riley feel good by positively comparing him to Buffy's former boyfriend Angel, but unintentionally makes him feel worse: she relates that she thinks Riley is good for Buffy because Buffy was always in tears over her tumultuous relationship with Angel, but that she never cries over Riley - she never \"gets that worked up\" over him. The impact of this revelation is evident in his face - this is yet another way that he can see that Buffy has kept him at an emotional distance and that she feels no intensity in their relationship. Back at The Magic Shop, Buffy talks with the gang about the possibility of helping her mother through the use of magics.||||| However, while Willow expresses willingness to help if she can, Tara and Giles both insist that the magical and the medical are not meant to mix, and that any attempts they made to help Joyce would likely only make things worse. They encourage her to put her faith in the doctors. As Anya sorts through receipts at The Magic Shop, she realizes Giles had sold items needed for an ancient Sobekian transmogrification spell - a Kohl's amulet and a Sobekian bloodstone. The gang describes the Temple of Sobekian as an ancient Egyptian cult who worshipped reptiles and were \"heavy into dark magic\", but the Sobekian spells were thought to have been lost for centuries.

Buffy arrives to stop her, temporarily interrupting the spell, but instead gets beaten up badly again. The cobra is transformed into a giant cobra monster with arms, and Glory sends the demon on a mission to locate the Key. Riley arrives at the magic shop in search of Buffy, but Xander confronts him about destroying the vampire crypt. The gang tells Riley that Buffy went after Glory, and he demands to know why they would let her do something so dangerous. Giles reminds Riley that \"let\" is not an issue when Buffy sets her mind to something.||||| Xander tells Riley that Buffy is so upset about the situation with her mom that she needs something tangible to fight, and then asks Riley what his excuse is for his own reckless actions. Buffy calls Giles from the hospital and tells him to take care of Dawn while she stays with her mother. She stays with her mother as the doctor tells her more bad news about Joyce's condition - she has a brain tumor, and they don't know yet if it is operable or not. Riley returns to Willy's bar to drink away his worries and again encounters the vampire Sandy. He allows her to bite him in the alley, but stakes her. The cobra demon arrives at the magic shop and goes after Dawn. Dawn screams in fear and the cobra retreats.||||| Realising that the cobra knows Dawn is the Key and is returning to inform Glory, Giles and Buffy go after the demon. Buffy catches up with it in a field near Glory's apartment and kills it, then lets out her pent-up frustration from her time at the hospital by continuing to beat up the lifeless cobra. Glory watches from a window, frustrated that her snake monster has failed to return in a timely manner. Joyce tells Dawn the truth about her health. Riley is there to comfort Buffy (wearing a turtleneck to hide his bite marks) but she refuses to accept comfort from him - she insists that she needs to stay strong for her family, refusing to cry.

Riley is left standing alone in the hallway, becoming increasingly frustrated with Buffy's inability or unwillingness to develop an emotional closeness with him, and to let herself be vulnerable around him.\nPlease provide a list of main concepts mentioned in the above story using the 5 W's, 1 H retell strategy.", "original_narrative": "Joyce gets a CAT scan at the hospital while Buffy and Dawn wait impatiently for news. Dawn asks Buffy why it is called a \"CAT Scan\" (do they test it on cats, or does the machine look like a cat?). Back at The Magic Box, Giles and Tara admire the new phone book advertisement for the magic shop while Anya is disappointed that she is not personally mentioned. Xander complains about Riley destroying the vampire crypt alone in the previous episode, and then the entire gang continues their search for information regarding the Beast. Giles agrees that it was reckless on Riley's part, while Anya expresses relief that the task was already completed, because she really hadn't wanted to start her day off with a slaughter (which, she notes, \"just goes to show how much I've grown!\").||||| In Glory's luxurious headquarters, a demon named Dreg offers a spell to Glory, groveling before her as she tries on elegant shoes, debating on whether they make her ankles look bony. Dreg promises that this spell will allow Glory to find the Key. She just needs some supplies, and she finds the advertisement for The Magic Box in the new phone book. Riley finds the front door to Buffy's house open, a blanket on the steps, and Spike in Buffy's room, sniffing her clothes. Spike declares that Buffy wouldn't care that he was in her room, and that the clothes-sniffing was just normal predator activity. Riley responds, \"Yeah, what's a little sweater-sniffing between sworn enemies?\" and drags him out and down the stairs, but not before Spike grabs a pair of Buffy's underwear.||||| Spike taunts Riley with his knowledge about Buffy's mother going to the hospital (which Buffy had failed to mention to Riley), as well as the time he and Buffy had spent together the previous evening eating, drinking, and talking. Spike insinuates Riley cannot keep Buffy satisfied, and Riley tells him to stay away from Buffy and throws him out into the sunlight, with his blanket. Riley shows up at the hospital to comfort Buffy, who seems relieved to see him. She directs him to sit with Dawn in the waiting room while she talks to their mother. Joyce confesses to Buffy that the doctors have found a \"shadow\" in her CAT scan, and they need to do an initial operation to evaluate her condition, and to discover whether surgery is an option. At The Magic Box, the Scoobies continue to search for information that might indicate the origins, purpose, or weaknesses of Glory.||||| Tara suggests that maybe the Beast is something that is too old for the books, which Giles believes may explain the presence of the Dagon Sphere, which is to ward against that \"which cannot be named.\" They discuss the possibility that Glory may predate language itself, when she herself shows up there and buys several items for a spell. The gang is, of course, oblivious to her true identity, and she leaves the store without incident. Back at the hospital, the doctor tells Buffy her mother has a brain tumor and presents her with her mother's options. Ben, an intern, gets the doctor away from Buffy, giving her a break from the doctor's constant questions. Riley takes Dawn to the park, where he tries to comfort her about her mother.||||| Dawn tries to make Riley feel good by positively comparing him to Buffy's former boyfriend Angel, but unintentionally makes him feel worse: she relates that she thinks Riley is good for Buffy because Buffy was always in tears over her tumultuous relationship with Angel, but that she never cries over Riley - she never \"gets that worked up\" over him. The impact of this revelation is evident in his face - this is yet another way that he can see that Buffy has kept him at an emotional distance and that she feels no intensity in their relationship. Back at The Magic Shop, Buffy talks with the gang about the possibility of helping her mother through the use of magics.||||| However, while Willow expresses willingness to help if she can, Tara and Giles both insist that the magical and the medical are not meant to mix, and that any attempts they made to help Joyce would likely only make things worse. They encourage her to put her faith in the doctors. As Anya sorts through receipts at The Magic Shop, she realizes Giles had sold items needed for an ancient Sobekian transmogrification spell - a Kohl's amulet and a Sobekian bloodstone.

Picking up from Season 3 's cliffhanger finale, Ross is revealed to have entered Rachel 's room, and ultimately choosing Rachel over Bonnie . As he enters the room, he sees both women. Bonnie has shaved her head, and it has consequently gotten sun burnt, Rachel is helping her apply sunblock onto it. Bonnie leaves the room when Ross is seen, and after sharing a kiss with Rachel, Ross goes to break up with Bonnie.||||| When he returns to Rachel's room and informs her that he has ended his relationship with Bonnie and she has left, he is bemused to then learn that while he was doing this Rachel had written him a letter that is eighteen pages long, front and back. Understandably tired after breaking up with Bonnie, Ross falls asleep at the kitchen table reading the letter, and when he wakes up the next morning, he lies and claims that he has read the letter thoroughly and carefully when he has not finished it. Believing him, Rachel asks him \"Does it?\" Unsure of what she wants him to say, Ross takes a guess and says \"It does.\" It immediately becomes clear that this is exactly what Rachel was hoping he would say - she is overjoyed and they get back together. When he later gets a chance to actually read the letter however, he discovers that Rachel wants him to take full responsibility for all that went wrong in their relationship, and is outraged.||||| At the beach, Monica and Chandler are still debating why he should be her boyfriend, when she gets stung by a jellyfish. Joey remembers a documentary from the Discovery channel that suggested urinating on a jellyfish sting to make the pain go away. He \"steps up\" to help her, but gets stage fright and cannot go through with it, so Chandler is forced to do it instead. The three are traumatized by this event and though initially unwilling to admit to the their curious friends what the matter with them is, eventually give into the group's pressure when they ask what happened and confess. Phoebe is shocked to learn the truth about Phoebe Abbott being her birth mother, and is very angry at her for never trying to track her down. She leaves her house saying that she never wants to see her again, but Phoebe Senior finds her at the Central Perk. Although her anger is still bubbling for her birth mother, Phoebe realizes that Phoebe Senior is her family and tries to get a rapport going on, albeit with some difficulty.||||| When the friends return to the city, Chandler, Monica and Joey confess what really happened at the beach.

The camera switches to Monica, Joey and Chandler hearing Ross yell, \"WE WERE ON A BREAK!\" and storming out of Rachel's bedroom, correcting the grammar in her letter as he leaves.

The fighting heads into the courtyard, where Cersei's men kill anyone who gets in their way. Sansa goes looking for her sister, but her nursemaid hears the fighting and sends Sansa to her room with strict instructions not to open the doors for anyone. The nursemaid confronts four armed men alone. Arya loses at her practicing when her teacher Syrio Forel says one direction and she listens and follows instead of reacting to what he's actually doing. He lectures her on following what she sees and reacting. Lannister men come for Arya, but Forel confronts them. Armed with only a wooden sword he takes on four men. She watches, amazed as he disarms all the men until the captain is left. Arya urges him to leave with her, but he refuses to back down.||||| The captain fights him and breaks the Forel's wooden sword. He sends Arya away, asking what they say to the god of death. \"Not today,\" she parrots. She leaves. She runs and hears screams as they fight. Sansa runs into the Hound in the hallway. She threatens to tell the queen. \"Who do you think sent me?\" he taunts. Arya runs into the courtyard and sees the box that holds her sword Needle. She looks for it when a boy comes up and threatens her.||||| She tells him to get away and whirls with her sword in her hand. She stabs him through the gut and runs. Varys pays Ned Stark a visit down in his dungeon cell. He tells him Arya escaped, but Sansa remains engaged to Joffrey. Varys tells Ned the rest of his household is all dead. Varys asks why he told Cersei he knew the truth. Ned claims it was mercy. Varys says Ned got Robert killed and tells him he's a dead man. Ned thinks he's safe because Catelyn has Tyrion, but Varys tells him Tyrion is free. Ned wants Varys to just kill him now, but he declines. On leaving, Varys claims to serve the realm, because no one else does.||||| Jon Snow and his men bring two dead men back from beyond the wall. Sam notices they're frozen solid and don't smell. The Lord Commander Mormont is notified of a raven from King's Landing. Jon joins him in his chambers and Mormont asks for ale for them both. He tells Snow of Robert's death and that Stark has been charged with treason for conspiring with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Joffrey. Sansa listens to Cersei, Master Pycelle, Varys and Petyr. Cersei says she can't marry Joffrey now because she's a traitor. Petyr argues she should have a chance to prove her loyalty. Cersei tells her to write to her mother and Robb, telling him to come to King's Landing and swear loyalty to Joffrey. She asks what will happen to her father. Cersei tells her that depends on her brother, and on her. Robb reads the letter, but Maester Luwin can tell Cersei told Sansa what to say. Robb knows he cannot ignore the official command, so he'll go -- but not alone. He tells Luwin to summon the banner men to defend his father. Hundreds of ravens fly from Winterfell.||||| At the Vale, Catelyn is incensed that her sister Lysa waited all day to show her the word from the raven. She wants Lysa to send men to fight for Ned, but Lysa worries about the safety of her son, Robin. She says the knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale to protect their lord. Tyrion and Bronn walk home. Bronn admits he's in it for the money. Tyrion says that's not a problem, he'll always pay more than the other guy. In the middle of the night, Bronn wakes up hearing noises. They are quickly surrounded by Stonecrows and their leader, Shagga, son of Dolf. Tyrion brags about his family's money while bashing their crappy weapons. Tyrion takes off his ring and hands it over. He tells him if they help him, he'll help the Stonecrows take over the Vale. Jon Snow works in the Wall kitchen, when his tormentor comes in and taunts him about being the bastard son of a traitor. Jon lunges at him with a knife, but men stop him. The Lord Commander comes in later and confines Jon to his quarters.||||| Later at night, Jon's direwolf Ghost won't stop barking. Jon lets him out and follows him to the commander's room. Instead of Mormont, a giant disfigured bald man comes at him. He stabs him, but the man keeps coming. The man falls and the Commander comes out of his room and sees. The man gets up and starts to attack again so Jon throws his lit lantern at him and hustles Mormont out. Daenerys walks through a burnt down village with Jorah as the Dothraki attack the inhabitants. He explains that the Dothraki are pillaging to raise money for ships to sail to Westeros, as she wants. Everywhere, women and children are screaming as the Dothraki attack them, claiming the spoils of their victory.||||| Daenerys commands them to stop attacking one woman. She claims others, even though Jorah tells her they belong to the warriors. Daenerys returns to camp to find her husband sitting next to a pile of severed heads. Mago , a warrior, is complaining to Khal that Daenerys took the women he was planning to \"mount.\" Daenerys makes a polite case for preventing the women from being raped, saying it is her will and as Khalessi he has to listen to her. Khal Drago enjoys seeing his fierce bride, but Mago says a khal who takes orders from a \"foreign whore\" isn't really a khal. He draws his sword. Drogo walks into it purposefully and presses his chest against it as he tells Mago what he'll do to his corpse. Without drawing his own weapon, Drogo ducks and darts to avoid Mago, then finally kills him with his own sword and rips out his tongue with his bare hands.||||| One of Daenerys's new slaves offers to help clean Drogo's cut. The Dothraki are suspicious, but Daenerys asks her husband to let the woman treat him. He relents. At Winterfell, Robb deals with the ego of the Greatjon, who demands he get to lead the vanguard into King's Landing, saying Robb is too green. He threatens to take his men and go home if not. Robb stares him down and says he's welcome to leave, but after he takes care of the Lannisters he'll come for him for breaking his oath to his father. Greatjon draws his sword and Robb's direwolf races at him and rips off a few fingers. Robb uses it as an excuse to show he knows enough to let a wolf deal with things for him. Cowed, the Greatjon laughs off the missing digits and the situation is diffused. Robb says good-bye to Bran in the middle of the night and tells him to stay at Winterfell. After he leaves, their younger brother Rickon comes in, worried about their parents.||||| The next day, Bran prays to the Old Gods. Osha, the captured wildling woman, tells him the gods heard him, but she predicts bad things for Robb headed south and tells Bran the true threat lies to the north. Sam, Jon Snow and the troops stand around the burning bodies of the men they found beyond the wall. Sam thinks they were touched by White Walkers. He read about them. He says they sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years. He hopes the wall is high enough to keep them out. Catelyn comes upon an encampment. Robb reports that the River Lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister on their heels, and Lord Tywin is bringing a larger army from the south. Catelyn walks in. She asks to talk to Robb alone, then hugs him. He shows her Sansa's letter. They notice there's no mention of Arya. Robb tells her he has 18,000 men.||||| Catelyn says their only hope is that he can defeat the Lannister army in the field. She reminds him what happened to the Targaryen children when they lost throne: they were butchered in their sleep, on the orders of Tywin Lannister. She tells him if he loses, the Starks all die. \"Well that makes it simple, then,\" he says. Tyrion and Bronn march with the Stonecrows. They reach Tywin Lannister's camp. Tyrion leads them in and makes introductions. Tyrion learns the Robert is dead and Cersei is essentially in charge of King's Landing. They know Robb called in his banners and is leading an army. Tyrion asks for the armor, swords and pikes to pay his debts. He's interrupted by an update from the field. Tywin announces he's moving against Robb Stark. He asks Shagga and his men to fight with him and promises them more loot. Shagga says only if Tyrion rides with them.||||| Robb tries to figure out his next move. They need to cross the river at the Twins, which Lord Frey controls. He's bannerman to Catelyn's father, but isn't exactly reliable. Robb's men bring in a Lannister spy they caught. They say he was counting the men. Robb asks how high he got. When the man says 20,000, Robb talks about mercy and commands his men to let him go. Robb tells the spy to tell Lord Tywin that \"winter is coming\" with 20,000 men. As soon as the spy leaves, the men wonder about his move. Ned is roused from his cell.||||| Sansa comes to court to hear Cersei force retirement on Ser Barristan from the King's Guard, which is supposed to be til death. \"You let my father die, you're too old to protect anyone,\" Joffrey snipes. Cersei announces Jaime will take over as lord commander of the King's Guard. Varys promises Barristan a good house, but Barristan is indignant. He draws his sword and tosses it on the floor, telling Joffrey to melt it and add it to the others in the throne. There's an announcement calling for any other business. Sansa steps forward. She begs mercy for her father. She reminds them that he never wanted to be hand and loved the king. She says Pycelle gave him milk of the poppy and he wasn't himself when he said Joffrey wasn't king. She begs Joffrey personally. Joffrey says Ned has to confess and say that he is the king or there will be no mercy. \"He will,\" she says.\nPlease provide a list of main concepts mentioned in the above story using the 5 W's, 1 H retell strategy.", "original_narrative": "Arya practices her swordplay while real swordplay spills out of the throne room after Cersei and Joffrey tried to claim the throne. The fighting heads into the courtyard, where Cersei's men kill anyone who gets in their way. Sansa goes looking for her sister, but her nursemaid hears the fighting and sends Sansa to her room with strict instructions not to open the doors for anyone. The nursemaid confronts four armed men alone. Arya loses at her practicing when her teacher Syrio Forel says one direction and she listens and follows instead of reacting to what he's actually doing. He lectures her on following what she sees and reacting. Lannister men come for Arya, but Forel confronts them. Armed with only a wooden sword he takes on four men. She watches, amazed as he disarms all the men until the captain is left. Arya urges him to leave with her, but he refuses to back down.||||| The captain fights him and breaks the Forel's wooden sword. He sends Arya away, asking what they say to the god of death. \"Not today,\" she parrots. She leaves. She runs and hears screams as they fight. Sansa runs into the Hound in the hallway. She threatens to tell the queen. \"Who do you think sent me?\" he taunts. Arya runs into the courtyard and sees the box that holds her sword Needle. She looks for it when a boy comes up and threatens her.||||| She tells him to get away and whirls with her sword in her hand. She stabs him through the gut and runs. Varys pays Ned Stark a visit down in his dungeon cell. He tells him Arya escaped, but Sansa remains engaged to Joffrey. Varys tells Ned the rest of his household is all dead. Varys asks why he told Cersei he knew the truth. Ned claims it was mercy. Varys says Ned got Robert killed and tells him he's a dead man. Ned thinks he's safe because Catelyn has Tyrion, but Varys tells him Tyrion is free. Ned wants Varys to just kill him now, but he declines. On leaving, Varys claims to serve the realm, because no one else does.||||| Jon Snow and his men bring two dead men back from beyond the wall. Sam notices they're frozen solid and don't smell. The Lord Commander Mormont is notified of a raven from King's Landing. Jon joins him in his chambers and Mormont asks for ale for them both. He tells Snow of Robert's death and that Stark has been charged with treason for conspiring with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Joffrey. Sansa listens to Cersei, Master Pycelle, Varys and Petyr. Cersei says she can't marry Joffrey now because she's a traitor. Petyr argues she should have a chance to prove her loyalty. Cersei tells her to write to her mother and Robb, telling him to come to King's Landing and swear loyalty to Joffrey. She asks what will happen to her father. Cersei tells her that depends on her brother, and on her. Robb reads the letter, but Maester Luwin can tell Cersei told Sansa what to say. Robb knows he cannot ignore the official command, so he'll go -- but not alone. He tells Luwin to summon the banner men to defend his father. Hundreds of ravens fly from Winterfell.||||| At the Vale, Catelyn is incensed that her sister Lysa waited all day to show her the word from the raven. She wants Lysa to send men to fight for Ned, but Lysa worries about the safety of her son, Robin. She says the knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale to protect their lord. Tyrion and Bronn walk home. Bronn admits he's in it for the money. Tyrion says that's not a problem, he'll always pay more than the other guy. In the middle of the night, Bronn wakes up hearing noises. They are quickly surrounded by Stonecrows and their leader, Shagga, son of Dolf. Tyrion brags about his family's money while bashing their crappy weapons. Tyrion takes off his ring and hands it over. He tells him if they help him, he'll help the Stonecrows take over the Vale. Jon Snow works in the Wall kitchen, when his tormentor comes in and taunts him about being the bastard son of a traitor. Jon lunges at him with a knife, but men stop him. The Lord Commander comes in later and confines Jon to his quarters.||||| Later at night, Jon's direwolf Ghost won't stop barking. Jon lets him out and follows him to the commander's room. Instead of Mormont, a giant disfigured bald man comes at him. He stabs him, but the man keeps coming. The man falls and the Commander comes out of his room and sees. The man gets up and starts to attack again so Jon throws his lit lantern at him and hustles Mormont out. Daenerys walks through a burnt down village with Jorah as the Dothraki attack the inhabitants. He explains that the Dothraki are pillaging to raise money for ships to sail to Westeros, as she wants. Everywhere, women and children are screaming as the Dothraki attack them, claiming the spoils of their victory.||||| Daenerys commands them to stop attacking one woman. She claims others, even though Jorah tells her they belong to the warriors. Daenerys returns to camp to find her husband sitting next to a pile of severed heads. Mago , a warrior, is complaining to Khal that Daenerys took the women he was planning to \"mount.\" Daenerys makes a polite case for preventing the women from being raped, saying it is her will and as Khalessi he has to listen to her.

The latest film Cecilia sees is a fictitious RKO Radio Pictures film, The Purple Rose of Cairo.

While in Egypt, the three meet archaeologist Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels).||||| Tom is brought back for a \"madcap Manhattan weekend\" where he falls head-over-heels for Kitty Haynes (Karen Akers), a chanteuse at the Copacabana. After Cecilia sits through the film several times, Tom, noticing her, breaks the fourth wall, and emerges from the inner film's black-and-white world into the full color real world the other side of the cinema screen. He tells Cecilia that he is attracted to her after noticing her watching him so many times, and she takes him around her New Jersey town.

Cecilia must choose between them and she decides to choose the real person of Gil rather than the fantasy figure of Tom.||||| She gives up the chance to return with Tom to his world, choosing to stay with Gil and have a 'real' life. Then she finally leaves her husband. But Gil's professions of love for Cecilia were false--he wooed her only to get Tom to return to the movie and thereby save his own Hollywood career.

The King of Mars commands the dreaded Lobster Man and his assistant Mombo, a gorilla wearing a space helmet, to pilot his flying saucer to Earth then steal its air. Once landed, the Lobster Man wastes no time transforming hapless victims into smoking skeletons. On a lonely road, John and Mary, a young and innocent couple discovers the hiding place of the flying saucer in a dark and mysterious cave. They attempt to warn the authorities but they are ignored. Successfully contacting Professor Plocostomos, a plan is created to lure the Lobster Man to Mr. Throckmorton's Haunted House that just happens to be surrounded by hot springs.||||| Once lured, it's simply a matter of pushing the dreaded Lobster Man into the hot water where he will be boiled to death.

How did the main character do what s/he did?\n\nStory: Elwood P. Dowd is an endlessly pleasant and delightfully eccentric bachelor living in a small town that isn't quite aware that its newest citizen is a invisible, 6'3\" white rabbit named \"Harvey,\" that only certain people can see. After supposedly meeting this rabbit - its origins attributed to the Celtic legend of the Pooka - Dowd's sanity is put into question by his equally eccentric sister, Veta Louise. Elwood casually drives his sister's guests from their house by introducing and carrying on one-sided conversations with his invisible and silent friend. His sister and niece, Myrtle Mae, resort to taking him to the local sanitarium to have him committed. However, owing to people not paying attention, interrupting, and cutting Elwood off as he is about to introduce his imaginary friend, it doesn't immediately appear that there is anything wrong with him, although the examining doctor is sure he is doing the right thing by admitting him.||||| Elwood is carted upstairs by a rough-handed and simple-minded man in the white coat while the examining doctor ushers the sister into the head psychiatrist's --Dr. Chumley's-- office to give a description of the problem. As Elwood is \"escorted\" to hydrotherapy, he tells the man in the white coat his friend \"Harvey\" is a \"Pooka\"||||| The Aide later looks up the definition in the dictionary: \"Celtic mythology, a mischievous spirit that takes animal form and appears sometimes to some people for the purpose of doing this and that.\" As Veta, still highly upset over Elwood driving away her friends, bemoans Elwoods delusions to Dr. Chumley, her frazzled manner and insistence that Elwood actually does have a six foot 3 inch invisible rabbit for a friend convinces Chumley it is she, not Elwood, who is hallucinating. He quickly has Veta carted upstairs and, fearing a lawsuit for incarcerating and treating a sane man, brings Elwood down and makes every manner of friendly gesture, including firing the examining doctor, Dr. Sanderson . His nurse, Miss Kelly, who is actually quite fond of Dr. Sanderson, is crestfallen, but, upset at being fired, the good doctor is unaware of her feelings for him, and this angers her.||||| Elwood in his normal good natured way takes no exception to any of the events and once again, as he is about to introduce \"Harvey,\" gets cut off, interrupted and ignored while Dr. Chumley pursues his patronizing commentary. Never one to interrupt, the pinnacle of politeness, Elwood lets him say whatever he is going to say and is finally given a pass to leave. Soon Veta's friends, including Judge Gaffney, and Myrtle Mae arrive. The mistake is uncovered, and the entire group goes into a panic trying to find Elwood. Veta and the Judge Gaffney promise to sue the sanitarium for wrongful incarceration and rough treatment. Distraught, Elwood drinks heavily and retires to his favorite watering hole, Charlie's. Dr. Chumley, himself, tracks Elwood down, but while he is doing this, everyone else is looking in other places. When it finally becomes apparent to everyone that the Doctor has been gone for over four hours and that Elwood is not back in custody, another major panic ensues and the group descends on Charlie's to see what has happened to Dr. Chumley.||||| Elwood, of course, is sitting alone, drinking, and maintains that the doctor left the bar with Harvey. They are convinced he is a madman and has done away with the doctor. However, in his easygoing and pleasant manner, Elwood sidetracks everyone with drinks and conversation and disarms them. Eventually the subject does turn back to the missing doctor, and the panic ensues again. The police are summoned, the heavy handed man in the white coat muscles Elwood back to the sanitarium, but not before becoming infatuated with Myrtle Mae and making advances toward her.||||| Although he is a big galoot, she's attracted to him. The entire entourage, of Veta, Myrtle Mae, Dr. Sanderson, Miss Kelly, Judge Gaffney, the guard and the police, arrive at the sanitarium in a police car and a taxi to discover the doctor is there. However, Dr. Chumley arrives back at the hospital with a look of admiration and fear. Dr. Chumley indeed did leave with Harvey, the Pooka, but he wisely does not say anything about it to anyone, dismisses them all and tells everyone that everything is under control. He tells Dr. Sanderson that he is a fine doctor and can have his job back, then disappears into his office. Sanderson then decides to administer a very powerful injection, called Formula 977, into Elwood that will make him cease with his delusions about the rabbit for once and for all.||||| Meanwhile the cab driver wants his money for the fare. No one seems to have any money so Veta says she'll pay. Digging everything out of her handbag, she discovers her money is gone. She assures the driver that if he waits until Elwood has his injection, she'll pay him handsomely when they are driven back home. The Cab driver however has dour insights into the effects of the injection about to be administered to Elwood. He says he's given many people a ride to the sanitarium for that injection and it changes them into crabby mean people; normal but irritable and unpleasant.||||| Elwood, the most disarming and engaging and mild mannered man in the universe, is on the verge of being turned permanently into a real nuisance, so Veta abruptly changes her mind and rushes in and prevents the injection. Dr. Chumley asks to see Elwood privately in his office where Elwood tells him tells the incredible story of how he came to meet Harvey, and explains the way in which people react when they meet them. Elwood also explains that Harvey has the power to stop time by saying:\n\n\"Did I tell you he could stop clocks? Well, you've heard the expression 'His face would stop a clock'? Well, Harvey can look at your clock and stop it. And you can go anywhere you like, with anyone you like, and stay as long as you like. And when you get back, not one minute will have ticked by. You see, science has overcome time and space. Well, Harvey has overcome not only time and space, but any objections.\"||||| By this point, Dr. Chumley is not only convinced of Harvey's existence, but has begun spending time with him on his own, and requests that Elwood allow Harvey to stay with him for a while and help him out by making his long-needed sabbatical a reality. Apparently this is one of the things Harvey can do if he is so inclined. Elwood asks Harvey if he will work with Chumley and tells Chumley that Harvey agrees. Dr. Sanderson pays for the cab and warms up to the nurse who has a crush on him. The entourage leaves, with the heavy-handed guard and Myrtle Mae making a date to see each other. As the sister digs in her pocketbook she discovers her money purse. She looks over her shoulder and says knowingly, \"Harvey,\" and shakes her head.||||| She knew Harvey existed, and was mischievous, and her only reason for wanting to have Elwood committed was that Elwood's insistence on introducing him to her guests was driving everyone away. As Elwood is leaving, Dr. Chumley asks Elwood for Harvey's help, and Elwood, being the obliging fellow he is, makes no objection. Dr. Chumley, arm in arm with an invisible companion, asks \"Have you ever been to Akron?\" In the final shot, after the gates to Chumley's Residence are closed, and Elwood is leaving, he stops, turns around and has a conversation with an invisible Harvey, who is already back from his trip to Akron (only a few minutes have gone by, but it was weeks due to Harvey the Pooka stopping time) and reaffirms their friendship. Harvey opens the security gate (showing only the control handles moving by themselves; Harvey is never seen on camera), and Elwood and his invisible companion saunter off towards the bus stop, following Veta and Myrtle Mae, towards the planned last stop of Charlie's Bar and another drink.\nPlease provide a list of main concepts mentioned in the above story using the 5 W's, 1 H retell strategy.", "original_narrative": "Elwood P.

As Homer writes them a refund check, they begin making out on his and Marge's mattress, and trade their new mattress for it. That night, when Homer and Marge are unsuccessfully trying to have sex, Homer admits he traded their mattress. Homer and Marge sneak in to the Lovejoys' home to steal back their mattress, but have sex on it until the Lovejoys return and catch them. Reverend Lovejoy solves the problem Solomon-style by cutting the mattress in half diagonally and gives one half to Homer and Marge.||||| On the way Homer convinces Marge to drive behind a billboard where they try to have sex as they did on their honeymoon with the same bum watching them. Bart's humiliation goes on as Bill and Marty tell everyone on the radio, and Jimbo, Dolph and Kearney sing a song about it called Bart Stinks, while the townspeople continue to mock and boo Bart. Lisa tries to cheer him up by taking him to see an old baseball star (Joe La Boot) who dropped a fly ball in the 1943 World Series but still grew up to be rich and famous, but after La Boot learns who Bart is, he makes everybody in the building boo him, making him feel worse about himself.||||| The next morning Lisa awakes to find someone has spray-painted \"I HATE BART SIMPSON\" all over the town, she assumes the culprit is someone who hates Bart the most, only for her and the rest of the family to find Bart, driven insane to the point of self-loathing due to the constant harassment, spray painting \"I HATE BART SIMPSON\" on a water tower.

Shortly, Del Boy enters, and he recognises the Australian man as being his old school friend and business partner, Jumbo Mills. Back in the 1960's, Del and Jumbo used to run a seafood stall outside the Nag's Head, until Jumbo emigrated to Australia in 1967, and now he is running a car business. Then, to prove if he's bald, Del yanks off Jumbo's wig when he's not looking. Rodney also enters, and Del introduces him and Albert to Jumbo. That evening, Del and Jumbo have a chat at the Nag's Head about how Del gave Jumbo his last PS200 when he went to Australia. Now, Jumbo wants to return the favour by asking Del to renew their partnership by running Jumbo's car business back in Australia. Del is reluctant at first, but agrees to the deal when Jumbo allows him to bring Rodney and Albert along.||||| Later, back at Nelson Mandela House, as Rodney and Albert are watching TV, Del returns and tells them that they're going to Australia. Rodney refuses to go, but changes his mind when Del shows him some photographs of Australia. They talk about how Jumbo will pay for their flight, and Rodney will be the head of a car-cleaning staff. Albert then speaks up and tells his nephews that he's not going with them to Australia, because Albert has had enough of travelling around the world with the Royal Navy, and just wants to settle down in Peckham during his retirement. Del and Rodney understand, and promise that they'll send money to Albert so he won't go poor. As Albert says thanks and goes off to bed, Rodney asks Del where they're going to live when they arrive in Australia, and Del says that Jumbo will allow them to live in his apartment for a while.||||| A few days later, Del gets a letter saying that he's been accepted for an immigration visa to Australia. Albert believes that nothing can go wrong. But Rodney walks into the lounge and tells his family that he's been refused an immigration visa because of his criminal conviction for smoking Cannabis at the art college in Basingstoke. As Albert heads off to the kitchen to keep out of the way, Del tells Rodney that he still wants to go to Australia and live out his dream of becoming a millionaire, even if it means ending their partnership. An irate Rodney complains to his older brother that he once had a golden opportunity to make money by becoming a window cleaner, but Del forced Rodney to give it up because of family ties. Del then tells Rodney that he will become the owner of Trotters Independent Traders, which involves trading nothing but 24 computers that don't work, and a Persian rug that is covered in food.||||| Rodney is still not happy with this idea, and lashes out at Del about how he raised him as his apprentice when their mother Joan died and their father Reg ran away. Del tries to calm Rodney down by saying that he'll send him money from the cars he and Jumbo sell, yet Rodney believes that the real opportunity to make money lies in Britain, because people who want a good bargain turn to traders like the Trotter brothers. Del then sternly says that he still wants to go to Australia, and that's final. Angered by Del's words, Rodney storms out of the flat in tears.

How did the main character do what s/he did?\n\nStory: Eren Jaeger stands momentarily speechless over the burned body of his childhood friend, Armin Arlelt . He realizes he should have known what would happen, but had no choice but to rely on him. Eren hears the weight of a Titan landing in the distance, and turns around in time to see the Cart Titan , carrying Zeke on its back. The Cart Titan gallops across the rooftops to reach Eren, who quickly moves to hold the unconscious Bertholdt Hoover hostage, placing his blade at the Warrior 's throat. As the Cart Titan stops, Eren gets a better look at Zeke and sees that he has marks around his face that shows he can turn into a Titan. He realizes that he is probably the Beast Titan . Zeke looks at Eren in shock and asks if he is Eren Jaeger. He says Eren looks nothing like his father and tells him that he knows what Eren is going through, as they are both victims of Grisha Jaeger. As Zeke tells Eren that he has been brainwashed by his father, Eren realizes that Zeke resembles Grisha.||||| However, Zeke looks up with consternation when he sees that Levi Ackermann has survived his battle with the remaining Titans and has climbed to the top of Wall Maria . Being in no shape to fight him again, Zeke calls their fight a draw and apologizes to the unconscious Bertholdt, saying that it is the end for him. The Cart Titan turns to leave and Zeke tells Eren that one day he will be coming back to rescue him. The Cart Titan gallops away with Zeke in tow.||||| Levi lands on the rooftop near Eren after using the last of his gas. He demands the rest of Eren's blades and gas so he can pursue Zeke. Eren begins to comply when he hears Armin gasp for breath. Elsewhere in Shiganshina District , Hange Zoe asks a conscious, but dismembered, Reiner Braun about a metal case that was in his chest pocket. He tells Hange that it is a letter written by Ymir , and that the Scouts need to deliver it to Christa . Hange agrees, but only after they inspect it. They would like to ask him more questions, but draws their blade, feeling that he is not inclined to talk. Reiner does not disagree.||||| However, when Hange begins to cut Reiner's throat, Jean Kirschtein asks them to wait, thinking they might be able to steal his power . Prior to beginning the operation, Erwin Smith had laid out guidelines for the use of the Scout Regiment 's one syringe of Titan injection , with the expectation that they could possibly take the Beast, Armored , or Colossal Titan 's powers. Not only could the Scouts gain valuable information regarding Titan powers, but they could also revive a single soldier on the brink of death. However, Hange does not feel that all the conditions have been met. Levi has the injection, but they do not know his status and they are uncertain they have the time to find out.||||| Even if Hange cuts off Reiner's head, they are not certain if that will actually kill him. Jean argues though, that this is not like Hange, and asks how they are supposed to beat the Titans if they back down because they lack the knowledge. Hange considers and asks Mikasa Ackermann to meet up with Eren and Armin to check out their situation, then to refill her gas and retrieve the injection from Levi. If she cannot, then she is to fire a signal flare as a signal to end Reiner. Mikasa agrees and flies off to find Levi.\n\nMikasa arrives to find Eren bent over Armin, desperately encouraging his friend to breathe. Eren hurriedly asks Levi for the syringe so they can have Armin eat Bertholdt. Levi, after a moment's hesitation, agrees and pulls out the case with the injection. Seeing this, Mikasa fires a signal flare as directed, but before Hange can kill Reiner, the Cart Titan gallops up behind them. Jean quickly fires his omni-directional mobility gear and pulls Hange out of the way before the Cart Titan can eat them.||||| Hange gets back up in time to see that the Cart Titan has picked up Reiner in its mouth, and it runs away with him and Zeke. Jean curses and blames himself for intervening when Hange was about to kill Reiner, but Hange reminds him that ultimately they made the call. Hange decides that they should regroup with the others. As Levi is about to hand Eren the Titan injection, Floch climbs up on the rooftop, carrying Erwin on his back. Erwin is severely wounded, but still alive, and Floch has been looking for Levi in hopes that the injection could save him. Seeing this, Levi takes back the injection and has Floch bring Erwin onto the roof. Levi inspects and confirms that Erwin is still breathing, then announces that Erwin will receive the injection. Eren is horrified, reminding Levi that he had already agreed to use it on Armin. Levi responds that he will revive the one who can save humanity. He hears a blade being drawn and turns to see that Mikasa has drawn her weapon, tears in her eyes.||||| On the Wall, Zeke surveys the wasteland of Shiganshina and notes that Reiner was incredibly lucky to have survived. Realizing what Eren and Mikasa intend, Levi asks them if they understand what they are doing. He reminds them that Erwin is their commander, and to stay out of his way. Eren grabs onto the serum in Levi's hand, and Levi orders him to keep his emotions in check. Eren then furiously asks why Levi did not use the serum on Armin right away. Levi admits that he was considering the possibility of Erwin still being alive, and now that Erwin is here, he will receive the injection. Eren tightens his grip on the Titan injection, and Levi, losing his patience, strikes Eren with his fist, knocking out several of his teeth and sending him flying. Outraged, Mikasa lunges at Levi and puts her blade to his throat. She realizes that Levi has been weakened from his previous battles, and she is certain that she can take the injection from him by force.||||| Both Levi and Floch appeal to her sense of reason and the need to save Erwin so they can use his talents to save humanity. Though Eren is barely able to speak, he counters that it would be no different if they lose Armin. Armin discovered Annie Leonhart 's identity as the Female Titan , he was the one who came up with the plan to save Trost and thought of moving soldiers at night, and it was thanks to Armin that they found Reiner and defeated Bertholdt. Eren believes that Armin will be the one who will save humanity, not Erwin or even Eren himself.||||| Mikasa renews her efforts to take the injection from Levi, but Floch stands up to her, saying that she is not the only one who has had it rough. Floch lets her know that all of the Scouts that were on the other side of the Wall are dead, killed by the Beast Titan's barrage. Erwin came up with a plan to fight back against the Beast Titan, and Floch's comrades were all slaughtered just as planned. When Floch found Erwin, he thought about killing him, but decided that would have been too easy. He wants Erwin to endure more of this hell, but then he looked to his left and saw Levi killing the Titans, and is reminded of the Titan injection. It takes a devil to fight the Titans, and Floch believes he was spared from dying so that he could bring Erwin back.||||| Floch tries to take the injection and Mikasa moves to intercept him, but Hange grabs her first and manages to pull her away before she can strike him. The rest of the squad has arrived now, and is able to see the choice that must be made. Levi gets up and opens the injection case, preparing to inject Erwin. Mikasa screams and Hange reminds her of how much they need Erwin and that they know what it is like to lose people.||||| Hange is only here now because Moblit Berner had died pushing them into a well to escape the Colossal Titan's transformation blast. Though there are countless people Hange wants to bring back, there comes a time to say farewell, and they have no choice but to keep moving forward. Hearing this, Mikasa finally relents and Levi prepares the injection. However, Eren weakly pulls at Levi's leg and asks him if he knows about the sea. Despite Floch's intervention, Eren tells Levi about Armin's dream to look at the sea, and admits that, though he was only ever driven by hatred of the Titans, Armin is not like him, and has dreams of his own. Levi glances at Armin's body and then gives the order for everyone to clear out so he can have Erwin eat Bertholdt. The group relocates, with Floch taking Eren away so he cannot intervene, and Levi is left alone.||||| Levi drags Bertholdt into position as he thinks about Erwin and Armin's respective dreams. He takes Erwin's arm and prepares to give him the injection when Erwin suddenly lifts it out of his grip and raises his hand, apparently believing himself to be back in his father's classroom. Delirious, Erwin asks his father how they can know for sure that there are no more humans outside the Walls. Levi regards him with surprise and remembers how he asked Erwin to give up on his dream, and how his uncle Kenny Ackermann had spoken about how people could only keep going if they were drunk on something. Remembering Erwin's gratitude to him, Levi makes his choice. Bertholdt wakes up in time to see a small blond Titan looming over him.||||| He begins to struggle and notices his former friends watching from several rooftops away. Bertholdt panics and cries out for help, but to no avail. As he screams for Annie and Reiner, Armin's Titan closes its jaws on his head and devours him. Floch asks Levi why he changed his mind as Levi and Hange sit beside Erwin's body. Levi explains that Erwin only became a devil because that was what was needed of him. He had been set free, but they were about to drag him back for more, and Levi decided it was time to let him rest. Levi apologizes to Erwin that he was not able to kill the Beast Titan like he promised, so he will have to wait. Hange inspects Erwin and lets Levi know that he has passed away. Behind them, the blond Titan collapses to the ground. Eren, Mikasa and the other 104th cadets surround it as Armin Arlelt emerges from the Titan, unharmed and healed.\nPlease provide a list of main concepts mentioned in the above story using the 5 W's, 1 H retell strategy.", "original_narrative": "Eren Jaeger stands momentarily speechless over the burned body of his childhood friend, Armin Arlelt . He realizes he should have known what would happen, but had no choice but to rely on him. Eren hears the weight of a Titan landing in the distance, and turns around in time to see the Cart Titan , carrying Zeke on its back. The Cart Titan gallops across the rooftops to reach Eren, who quickly moves to hold the unconscious Bertholdt Hoover hostage, placing his blade at the Warrior 's throat. As the Cart Titan stops, Eren gets a better look at Zeke and sees that he has marks around his face that shows he can turn into a Titan. He realizes that he is probably the Beast Titan . Zeke looks at Eren in shock and asks if he is Eren Jaeger. He says Eren looks nothing like his father and tells him that he knows what Eren is going through, as they are both victims of Grisha Jaeger. As Zeke tells Eren that he has been brainwashed by his father, Eren realizes that Zeke resembles Grisha.||||| However, Zeke looks up with consternation when he sees that Levi Ackermann has survived his battle with the remaining Titans and has climbed to the top of Wall Maria . Being in no shape to fight him again, Zeke calls their fight a draw and apologizes to the unconscious Bertholdt, saying that it is the end for him. The Cart Titan turns to leave and Zeke tells Eren that one day he will be coming back to rescue him. The Cart Titan gallops away with Zeke in tow.||||| Levi lands on the rooftop near Eren after using the last of his gas. He demands the rest of Eren's blades and gas so he can pursue Zeke. Eren begins to comply when he hears Armin gasp for breath. Elsewhere in Shiganshina District , Hange Zoe asks a conscious, but dismembered, Reiner Braun about a metal case that was in his chest pocket. He tells Hange that it is a letter written by Ymir , and that the Scouts need to deliver it to Christa . Hange agrees, but only after they inspect it. They would like to ask him more questions, but draws their blade, feeling that he is not inclined to talk. Reiner does not disagree.||||| However, when Hange begins to cut Reiner's throat, Jean Kirschtein asks them to wait, thinking they might be able to steal his power . Prior to beginning the operation, Erwin Smith had laid out guidelines for the use of the Scout Regiment 's one syringe of Titan injection , with the expectation that they could possibly take the Beast, Armored , or Colossal Titan 's powers. Not only could the Scouts gain valuable information regarding Titan powers, but they could also revive a single soldier on the brink of death. However, Hange does not feel that all the conditions have been met. Levi has the injection, but they do not know his status and they are uncertain they have the time to find out.||||| Even if Hange cuts off Reiner's head, they are not certain if that will actually kill him. Jean argues though, that this is not like Hange, and asks how they are supposed to beat the Titans if they back down because they lack the knowledge.

Black shows up and says he wants their help sending David a message and then proceeds to backhand Emily across the face We see Jack informing David that Black has been released and his flash drive is gone. Since Black thinks Kate is still alive David knows he won't leave town anytime soon. At the station Jack asks Hunter to help him find Black. It turns out Hunter is pretty well informed on the situation, including Emily's real identity. He uses Alvarez' disappearance to convince Hunter to help. David is texted a video from Black that features Emily and Victoria. He wants his daughter back the following day, unharmed. David fills in Jack and Hunter as to the latest with Black's demands. David doesn't think they should involve anyone else. Margot flashes back to a conversation with Victoria where she's confessed to hurting David in order to save Daniel. Victoria she think she owes it to David not to go after Emily.||||| Victoria isn't interested in helping Emily try to escape from their imprisonment. Louise's mother Penelope shows up to see her daughter and introduces herself to Nolan. To Louise's horror Penelope has rented a place for the summer. David used recordings of Kate's voice to make Black think she's still alive. He arranges a meet-up for a type of prisoner exchange. Penelope drops by to see Louise at her hotel room. She references the fact that she is Louise's legal conservator. She's worried that Louise will screw up things for her brother's political career, threatening to cut off her money. Hunter and Jack track down Emily's car. They notice a security camera nearby and Jack has an idea. Victoria tries to trade her freedom for information that will lead Black to his daughter. She gives him Jack's name. Jack rushes to David and tells him he has a plan to track down the ladies. David doesn't think there's time and says he's going to take care of things on his own. Jack seems convinces Emily will find a way to get herself free.||||| Now handcuffed after a brief failed attempt to escape, Emily and Victoria talk about how they got into this mess. Emily tells Victoria about David's plan to kill her and stage a suicide. Louise updates Nolan about her mother's orders that if she goes public with the drugging she'll be cut off. She talks about her father, the only person that kept her sane all those years with her mother. Nolan starts brainstorming a way they can get her money away from Penelope. Jack meets with Hunter only to find he's been tied up by one of Black's henchman. Jack is able to fight the goon off and knock him out. At the meeting with Black, David attempts to trick him into showing him Emily. But Black has only brought Victoria and quickly realizes that his daughter isn't there and is probably dead. He shoots David in the leg and say he plans to make him suffer.||||| Hunter found nothing on the security tape and they doubt they'll get any info from Black's goon. But Jack notices that Emily drew a star with a circle on the man's shirt. It is part of a game Jack and Emily used to play as kids. When Hunter smells coal they figure out where the women are being held. Back at his lair Black tells David he wants him to watch Victoria and Emily die. After David \"it's me you want\" he tosses him a knife and says \"just for old times sake, why don't you do the work while I watch.\" Margot begins the process of collecting incriminating information on someone, presumably Emily. Black opens the door to the incinerator and grabs a knife. But just before he can stab Emily, Victoria takes credit for killing Black's daughter, adding \"I loved it.\" Black starts choking Victoria, just as Hunter and Jack arrive.||||| A fight ensues, the result of which is Emily briefly freeing herself and knocking Black out with a huge piece of coal. Black turns the table and brings Emily to the edge of the incinerator. But David pops up at the last moment and shoots Black, killing him. Police arrive and begin to clean thing up. Jack tells Emily he plans to tell the police the truth about Black's daughter. As he lays on a gurney Victoria tells David she knows he was trying to kill her. She says she's going to mourn her son and they should go their separate ways.||||| Louise and Nolan tell Penelope they've gotten married. This makes Nolan her conservator. Penelope says that if she doesn't give her control back she'll make it public that Louise killed her own father. Emily thanks Hunter and asks him why he helped them. He says he thinks what she did must have been for the right reasons and promises to keep her secret. The episode ends with Margot talking to Victoria about her plan to dig up dirt on Emily. Since presumably Victoria is no longer loyal to David, she should be cool with Margot going after Emily. Victoria disagrees, saying all that matters is \"you and my grandchild.\" When Margot seems dead-set on going after Emily, Victoria warns her to wait until she has \"irrefutable proof.\"\nPlease provide a list of main concepts mentioned in the above story using the 5 W's, 1 H retell strategy.", "original_narrative": "So we begin with Emily and Victoria waking up in captivity.

At the meeting with Black, David attempts to trick him into showing him Emily. But Black has only brought Victoria and quickly realizes that his daughter isn't there and is probably dead. He shoots David in the leg and say he plans to make him suffer.||||| Hunter found nothing on the security tape and they doubt they'll get any info from Black's goon. But Jack notices that Emily drew a star with a circle on the man's shirt. It is part of a game Jack and Emily used to play as kids. When Hunter smells coal they figure out where the women are being held. Back at his lair Black tells David he wants him to watch Victoria and Emily die. After David \"it's me you want\" he tosses him a knife and says \"just for old times sake, why don't you do the work while I watch.\" Margot begins the process of collecting incriminating information on someone, presumably Emily. Black opens the door to the incinerator and grabs a knife. But just before he can stab Emily, Victoria takes credit for killing Black's daughter, adding \"I loved it.\" Black starts choking Victoria, just as Hunter and Jack arrive.||||| A fight ensues, the result of which is Emily briefly freeing herself and knocking Black out with a huge piece of coal. Black turns the table and brings Emily to the edge of the incinerator. But David pops up at the last moment and shoots Black, killing him. Police arrive and begin to clean thing up. Jack tells Emily he plans to tell the police the truth about Black's daughter. As he lays on a gurney Victoria tells David she knows he was trying to kill her. She says she's going to mourn her son and they should go their separate ways.||||| Louise and Nolan tell Penelope they've gotten married. This makes Nolan her conservator. Penelope says that if she doesn't give her control back she'll make it public that Louise killed her own father. Emily thanks Hunter and asks him why he helped them. He says he thinks what she did must have been for the right reasons and promises to keep her secret. The episode ends with Margot talking to Victoria about her plan to dig up dirt on Emily. Since presumably Victoria is no longer loyal to David, she should be cool with Margot going after Emily. Victoria disagrees, saying all that matters is \"you and my grandchild.\" When Margot seems dead-set on going after Emily, Victoria warns her to wait until she has \"irrefutable proof.\"", "row": 57, "response": "Here are the main concepts mentioned in the story using the 5 W's, 1 H retell strategy:\n\n**Who:**\n\n* Emily\n* Victoria\n* Black\n* David\n* Jack\n* Hunter\n* Louise\n* Nolan\n* Penelope\n* Margot\n* Kate\n* Daniel\n* Alvarez\n\n**What:**\n\n* Emily and Victoria are held captive by Black\n* Black demands David to return his daughter in exchange for Emily and Victoria\n* David tries to trick Black and rescue Emily and Victoria\n* Jack and Hunter try to track down Black and rescue Emily and Victoria\n* Louise tries to escape her mother's control\n* Margot tries to collect incriminating information on Emily\n\n**When:**\n\n* The story takes place in the present, with flashbacks to previous conversations between Victoria and Margot\n\n**Where:**\n\n* The story takes place in various locations, including a captivity site, a police station, a hotel room, and a lair\n\n**Why:**\n\n* Black wants to avenge his daughter's death and punish David\n* David wants to rescue Emily and Victoria\n* Jack wants to help David and rescue Emily and Victoria\n* Louise wants to escape her mother's control and protect her brother's political career\n* Margot wants to collect incriminating information on Emily to use against her\n\n**How:**\n\n* Black uses violence and intimidation to get what he wants\n* David uses trickery and deception to try to rescue Emily and Victoria\n* Jack and Hunter use detective work and fighting skills to track down Black and rescue Emily and Victoria\n* Louise uses her relationship with Nolan to try to escape her mother's control\n* Margot uses her skills and resources to collect incriminating information on Emily", "decomposed_mcs": ["Here is the list of main concepts in plain text format.", "Emily", "Victoria", "Black", "David", "Jack", "Hunter", "Louise", "Nolan", "Penelope", "Margot", "Kate", "Daniel", "Alvarez", "Emily is held captive by Black.", "Victoria is held captive by Black.", "Black demands David to return his daughter.", "Black demands to return Emily in exchange.", "Black demands to return Victoria in exchange.", "David tries to trick Black.", "David tries to rescue Emily.", "David tries to rescue Victoria.", "Jack tries to track down Black.", "Hunter tries to track down Black.", "Jack tries to rescue Emily.", "Jack tries to rescue Victoria.", "Hunter tries to rescue Emily.", "Hunter tries to rescue Victoria.", "Louise tries to escape her mother's control.", "Margot tries to collect incriminating information on Emily.", "The story takes place in the present.", "The story has flashbacks to previous conversations between Victoria and Margot.", "The story takes place in a captivity site.", "The story takes place in a police station.", "The story takes place in a hotel room.", "The story takes place in a lair.", "Black wants to avenge his daughter's death.", "Black wants to punish David.", "David wants to rescue Emily.", "David wants to rescue Victoria.", "Jack wants to help David.", "Jack wants to rescue Emily.", "Jack wants to rescue Victoria.", "Louise wants to escape her mother's control.", "Louise wants to protect her brother's political career.", "Margot wants to collect incriminating information on Emily.", "Margot wants to use the collected information against Emily.", "Black uses violence to get what he wants.", "Black uses intimidation to get what he wants.", "David uses trickery to try to rescue Emily and Victoria.", "David uses deception to try to rescue Emily and Victoria.", "Jack uses detective work to track down Black.", "Jack uses fighting skills to track down Black.", "Hunter uses detective work to track down Black.", "Hunter uses fighting skills to track down Black.", "Jack and Hunter track down Black to rescue Emily.", "Jack and Hunter track down Black to rescue Victoria.", "Louise uses her relationship with Nolan.", "Louise tries to escape her mother's control.", "Margot uses her skills to collect incriminating information on Emily.", "Margot uses her resources to collect incriminating information on Emily."]}

Shaq and Dr. Phil have only two minutes to free themselves of their leg braces before dying from the room's airborne nerve gas. Finally, Shaq makes the basket and lowers the saws down.

Tom Logan (Charlie Sheen), spoofing Bill Pullman's character from The Grudge, wakes up.||||| There are three girls (from The Girls Next Door on E!) in his bed who later have a pillow fight. He tries to kill himself by taking too many sleeping pills but the pills turn out to be Viagra, resulting in him tumbling over a balustrade, landing on his erect penis, and dying.

At a bar afterwards he runs into Mahalik (Anthony Anderson) and CJ (Kevin Hart) where it is revealed, in a parody of Brokeback Mountain, that the two have started a homosexual relationship. Tom gets home, where his ex-wife (Molly Shannon) has just arrived with his children, Robbie and Rachel, who both resent him.

Penny and the gang are enjoying dinner as Sheldon observes that the best things in life are free, looking over at Penny. Howard needs to know from Raj if he is bringing someone to the wedding. Raj gets defensive and then becomes vague and evasive, all to cover for the fact that he has no one to bring along. Sheldon liked one wedding he went to that had a make-your-own-sundae bar. Howard and Bernadette aren't having one. Apparently, Raj is desperate enough for a date where to ask his parents to send him a match. Since they have suspicions that he might be homosexual, they do ask him if he wants a female wife. His father thinks he is being smart asking for a matchmaker and that it's better than marrying for love.||||| His wife points out that THEY married for love. Penny decided to pay back Sheldon and Leonard for always eating at their apartment . She cashed a residual check from her hemorrhoid commercial and bought them gifts. Sheldon got a vintage 1975 Mego Star Trek Transporter with real transporter action. He got excited and gave her a finger gun keeping his hugs for extra special occasions. She went to the comic book store by herself and caused two guys to have asthma attacks which she said felt pretty good. Leonard got a Label label maker which was also \"mint in box\" as was the transporter. That was Penny's prank since she also got Leonard a transporter. Sheldon has a Mr. Spock figurine that will fit in. Penny wants to open them up so they can put in the Character (arts)|character and play with them. Both object because once you open the box, it loses its value. Penny's Mom said the same thing about her virginity, but she found it more fun when she took it out and played with it.||||| Raj brings Howard and Bernadette with him to chaperone his date; not unusual for first meetings in arranged marriages. Also since they're short, Raj will feel like he's six foot two. Lakshmi arrived and Raj is feeling good about it. (\"I'm thinking double-wedding.\") While staring at his whiteboard Sheldon sighs that it's like looking at the universe naked. He hears a voice calling out to him. It's his Mr. Spock action-figure.

Little Spock. Penny and the gang are enjoying dinner as Sheldon observes that the best things in life are free, looking over at Penny. Howard needs to know from Raj if he is bringing someone to the wedding. Raj gets defensive and then becomes vague and evasive, all to cover for the fact that he has no one to bring along. Sheldon liked one wedding he went to that had a make-your-own-sundae bar. Howard and Bernadette aren't having one. Apparently, Raj is desperate enough for a date where to ask his parents to send him a match. Since they have suspicions that he might be homosexual, they do ask him if he wants a female wife. His father thinks he is being smart asking for a matchmaker and that it's better than marrying for love.||||| His wife points out that THEY married for love. Penny decided to pay back Sheldon and Leonard for always eating at their apartment . She cashed a residual check from her hemorrhoid commercial and bought them gifts. Sheldon got a vintage 1975 Mego Star Trek Transporter with real transporter action. He got excited and gave her a finger gun keeping his hugs for extra special occasions. She went to the comic book store by herself and caused two guys to have asthma attacks which she said felt pretty good. Leonard got a Label label maker which was also \"mint in box\" as was the transporter. That was Penny's prank since she also got Leonard a transporter. Sheldon has a Mr. Spock figurine that will fit in. Penny wants to open them up so they can put in the Character (arts)|character and play with them. Both object because once you open the box, it loses its value. Penny's Mom said the same thing about her virginity, but she found it more fun when she took it out and played with it.||||| Raj brings Howard and Bernadette with him to chaperone his date; not unusual for first meetings in arranged marriages. Also since they're short, Raj will feel like he's six foot two. Lakshmi arrived and Raj is feeling good about it. (\"I'm thinking double-wedding.\") While staring at his whiteboard Sheldon sighs that it's like looking at the universe naked. He hears a voice calling out to him. It's his Mr. Spock action-figure.

How did the main character do what s/he did?\n\nStory: Photographer Jerry Manley arrives at the Venezuelan base camp of entomologist Dr. James Atherton. Despite Jerry's complaint of fever, James whisks him by helicopter to a remote giant sinkhole, where Jerry helps James and his assistants set up cones to catch falling butterflies as James pumps smoke into the trees. Several huge spiders also fall, and James captures two in jars, but a third spider slips into Jerry Manley's backpack. Back in camp, as James studies the spiders, he notes that, like solider ants, they have no reproductive organs. While Jerry rests in his tent, the third spider crawls from his backpack and delivers a fatal bite to his stomach. Thinking Jerry died of fever, James packs his body into a box to be shipped home, but the spider slips inside. When the body arrives in Canaima, California, mortician Irv Kendall is shocked at its desiccated condition, as if something sucked it dry. The spider sneaks out of the box and escapes through a cat door.||||| A crow swoops down and picks it up, but soon plummets lifelessly into the yard of a house where Dr. Ross Jennings, his wife Molly, and children Tommy and Shelley have just arrived from San Francisco, California. Dr. Jennings has chosen to take over as town physician when Dr. Samuel \"Sam\" Metcalf retires the following week. Tommy Jennings sees the large spider and reports it to his mother, who finds a smaller, harmless spider instead and releases it in the barn out back. The foreign spider joins the domestic spider, and the two mate. When Dr. Jennings visits Sam to discuss taking over his practice, the old physician has second thoughts about retiring. Jennings panics, because he has bought a house and rented an office in Canaima. Retired schoolteacher Margaret Hollins volunteers to be his first patient, and when he gives her a check-up, he discovers that Sam unnecessarily put Margaret on high blood pressure medication.||||| Meanwhile, Molly, an amateur photographer, takes pictures of a large web in the barn. Hoping to cure her husband of his fear of spiders, she takes him to see it, but Ross is terrified by his earliest childhood memory of a spider crawling on him. Just out of sight in the loft, an egg sac pulsates. Later, Margaret throws a lawn party to introduce Dr. Jennings to the townspeople, and Tommy and Shelley make friends with neighbor Bunny Beechwood, whose father, Henry Beechwood, is the high school coach. Other guests include Jerry Manley's parents, grieving over their son's death and angry they could not view his body before burial. That evening, a spider gets into Margaret's house and fatally bites her hand. The next day, Dr. Jennings attempts to convert his basement into a wine cellar, but the wood is rotten. When he fires a nail gun into the ceiling, the nails shoot through the floor boards above.||||| He goes to Margaret's to thank her for the party, and sees her body through a window. Sam Metcalf declares she had a heart attack and blames Ross for taking her off blood pressure pills. Recognizing signs of convulsion, Ross suggests an autopsy, but Sam refuses, because locals object to having their bodies desecrated. Margaret is buried without being examined. Meanwhile, Molly Jennings hires local exterminator Delbert McClintock to check the house for termites, but he finds only \"bad wood.\" Henry Beechwood asks Dr. Jennings to give his football players physical examinations. Later, during practice, a spider crawls into a football helmet. After player Todd Miller puts it on, he is bitten while being tackled and dies. His teammates surround him, take off the helmet, and lay it aside. Nobody sees the spider crawling out, but a player steps on it and kills the arachnid without noticing.||||| Though Todd's death is blamed on the tackle, some wonder if Dr. Jennings is to blame and call him \"Dr. Death.\" That night, Dr. Sam Metcalf steps off his treadmill before bed, puts his foot into a slipper, and is bitten. His wife, Evelyn, calls Dr. Jennings, but the old doctor is dead by the time he arrives. When County Medical Examiner Milton \"Milt\" Briggs arrives, Dr. Jennings tells him that Metcalf's wife saw a spider, then shows him a bite on the old doctor's toe. Milt argues, however, that spider bites are rarely fatal. He blames the elderly doctor's death on overexertion on the treadmill. Dr. Jennings demands an autopsy, and the next day, Briggs telephones to say Dr. Metcalf died from a tiny amount of unknown toxin. Over the objection of Sheriff Lloyd Parsons, Dr. Jennings asks Milt to exhume Todd Miller and Margaret Hollins.||||| Dr. Jennings warns his children to watch out for spiders. While playing with Bunny at the Beechwood house, Shelley Jennings is almost bitten by a spider, but Bunny innocently drops a large book on it. Meanwhile, Ross finds a cricket in the house and realizes he has not heard them lately, even though crickets chirping on quiet evenings was one of Canaima's selling points. Seeing that Dr. James Atherton, one of America's foremost entomologists, is studying spiders at a California university, he telephones him. Atherton tells him that people frequently report false outbreaks of spider deaths. However, after he hangs up, Dr. Atherton vaguely recalls the name Canaima. Studying his new species of Venezuelan spiders, he asks his assistant, Chris Collins, to investigate. Chris arrives in Canaima just as Dr. Jennings and Milt find spider bites on the exhumed bodies of Todd Miller and Margaret Hollis. The young assistant telephones Dr. Atherton and asks him to come.||||| The next day, as Dr. Jennings, Milt, Sheriff Parsons, and Chris search Margaret's property, they find a large web filled with fragments of crickets, along with a dead spider. Chris Collins observes that another spider drained it, because spiders are like vampires. Suddenly, a spider menaces them. Dr. Jennings freezes with fear, but makes enough movement to distract the spider, allowing Chris to drop a glass over it. Nearby, as Bunny's older sister, Becky Beechwood, takes a shower, a spider drops on her from the shower rod, but the rushing water sends it skittering down into the drain. Henry Beechwood telephones Delbert McClintock, who arrives and finds a spider on the front walk. The exterminator's insecticide has no effect, however, so he squashes the spider with his boot. When Dr. James Atherton arrives in town, Dr. Jennings claims that he and Irv Kendall have already figured out that a spider escaped from his Venezuelan camp in Jerry Manley's casket.||||| Studying the captured spider, Atherton notes the huge fangs and the lack of sex organs, which is uncharacteristic of spiders, except for the Venezuelan species. He explains that this type of spider has been trapped for millennia in a deep gorge, but now one of them has mated with a local species, and their offspring will spread out. Though these sexless spiders will soon die, a new queen has probably been born, and her offspring will be unstoppable. Her nest must be destroyed. That night, at Irv Kendall's house, a spider gets into a bowl of popcorn and kills him and his wife. The next day, when Atherton goes to Dr. Jennings' office with Sheriff Parsons, he sees Molly's photographs of the huge barn web and demands to go there. Elsewhere, Chris Collins tells Dr. Jennings the queen will be hiding in a dark, musty place, and no other spiders will be around because the queen protects her babies.||||| Plotting a map of where spiders were seen or people were bitten, Chris draws a circle around the Jennings house. Meanwhile, as Atherton investigates the web in the barn, the original Venezuelan spider fatally bites him. Dr. Jennings arrives to evacuate his family, but they are surrounded by hundreds of spiders and must escape through an upstairs window. However, Jennings again freezes at the top of the stairs and tumbles over the railing. He crashes through the rotted ground floor and lands in the cellar. Seeing no spiders, he knows from what Chris Collins said that this must be where the queen is hiding.||||| When it attacks him, he shovels the spider toward a broken fuse box and electrocutes her. Finding a giant egg sac, he douses it with wine. As the original Venezuelan spider drops down on him, he knocks it away, chases it with flames, and sets part of the basement on fire. He momentarily freezes as the spider crawls up his leg, then knocks it away into the fire. As the flaming creature leaps at him again, Ross fires his nail gun and sends the burning spider into the egg sac, setting it afire. Delbert McClintock pulls him to safety. Later, Dr. Jennings and his wife, having returned to San Francisco, drink wine, happy to be home.

Vincent have to keep their marriage a secret when investigator, Daniel Breeden, uncovers evidence that may show that the governor took a bribe from John F. Holdstock, an embezzling financier he pardoned. John's private secretary, Willis Martin, who deposited the bribe money in the governor's private bank account, tells Robert and Daniel that he knows of no business between John and the governor that would explain the money. Sheldon goes to the Governor's Residence to tell Ruth about the situation, and that he is obligated to present the evidence to a legislative investigation committee. Ruth is certain that her father did not take a bribe, and that John can explain everything, but they learn by phone from Daniel that John has committed suicide. The Governor is concerned about the allegations, but his financial backer, Jim Lansdale, calms him down, and takes him to lunch. Before he does he makes a phone call in which he learns that Sheldon is at the Governor's residence, but he does not tell the Governor this.||||| In John's papers, Robert finds a typed note which apparently provides a motive for the bribe: \"My dear friend John ... the expense of maintaining my sockfarm has exceeded the income during the year ... the time for the matter we discussed has come. W.H.V.\" Robert rushes to show it to Ruth, and they decide to take it to police headquarters to be compared with a sample from the governor's personal typewriter. Lt.

Vincent have to keep their marriage a secret when investigator, Daniel Breeden, uncovers evidence that may show that the governor took a bribe from John F. Holdstock, an embezzling financier he pardoned. John's private secretary, Willis Martin, who deposited the bribe money in the governor's private bank account, tells Robert and Daniel that he knows of no business between John and the governor that would explain the money. Sheldon goes to the Governor's Residence to tell Ruth about the situation, and that he is obligated to present the evidence to a legislative investigation committee. Ruth is certain that her father did not take a bribe, and that John can explain everything, but they learn by phone from Daniel that John has committed suicide. The Governor is concerned about the allegations, but his financial backer, Jim Lansdale, calms him down, and takes him to lunch. Before he does he makes a phone call in which he learns that Sheldon is at the Governor's residence, but he does not tell the Governor this.||||| In John's papers, Robert finds a typed note which apparently provides a motive for the bribe: \"My dear friend John ... the expense of maintaining my sockfarm has exceeded the income during the year ... the time for the matter we discussed has come.

Bosko appears and does a Mexican style dance with the cow. At one point, the cow's \"pants\" drop, revealing polka-dotted underwear. Bosko points and laughs, at which the cow pulls her pants back on and walks off in a huff--with her nose up and tail held erect. Next, Bosko laughs heartily at a horse and the horse laughs back. He then climbs onto the horse carriage and uses a whip to play the horse's tail like a violin. He tunes the \"horse\" by twisting his ear. The horse seems to enjoy the music and dances in an odd fashion. He skates along, floats a few feet above the ground and makes swishing movements, with his hooves, as if mimicking a mop. Bosko then takes a rake and starts playing it like a fiddle, as the horse begins trotting on two legs.||||| The scene cuts to three ducklings and their mother. Whilst walking in single file, they start bouncing on their rears in tune to the music. The mother duck starts to sway and the ducklings follow her lead. One of the ducklings, crosses its legs and whispers something in the mother duck's ear. She undoes a flap on his rear, as if he was wearing pants, and motions him off screen, presumably to relieve himself. When he returns, she replaces the flap and they all jump into a pond. The scene moves back to Bosko and the horse. It seems to be an exact repeat of the earlier dance routine, with Bosko playing the horse's tail while the horse goes through his unique dance moves. Bosko eventually slides down the horse's neck and goes to feed the pigs, who seem to be squealing in hunger. He tilts a trash can into their trough, and they eat greedily.||||| One of the piglets finds a bottle of booze and tries to loosen the cork. Eventually, he manages to open it using the other piglet's tail as a corkscrew. Bubbles begin to float out, and the piglets pop them merrily, making xylophone-like sounds that play How dry I am. They start drinking it and soon get drunk. Their father comes over and starts drinking from the bottle too. He laughs with a deep bass guffaw and sings One Little Drink, using nonsense syllables. He gestures expressively and flings the bottle away which shatters against Bosko's head. Bosko becomes soaked in booze and inebriated. He walks over to the pigs and they sing Sweet Adeline together, barbershop style. The father pig launches into One Little Drink again, but the effort causes him to belch up a corn cob. Looking embarrassed, he uses his belly button like a knob to open the door to his stomach and puts the cob back inside. He starts to sing again and Bosko helps him reach for the final low note by pulling his tail, which deflates him temporarily.

When Goodwin sees his prize horses being taken, he pulls out a gun, but Dillon shoots and kills him. Goodwin's young son Peter runs out crying and screaming at the departing soldiers. In 1938, Peter, now a crotchety old man, still resides on Elmtree Farm and raises horses with his niece Sally. Dillon's grandson Jack returns from England, where he has been learning the banking business for eight years. Although Jack wants to breed, train and race horses, his father convinces him to work in his bank and train horses as a hobby. Sally's father encounters Jack's father at the track and asks if he could get a loan from his bank to buy cotton.||||| Dillon says that he will take the matter up with his board, and then, because Jack is anxious to cross horses with the Dillons', they roll dice to see who will give up a horse to the other. Dillon loses and writes Goodwin a note for the horse. When Dillon speaks against the loan to the board of the bank because it is for speculation in cotton, Jack argues against his father and questions whether his motives are personal. The loan does not pass, and when cotton prices fall, Goodwin has a heart attack and dies. Jack leaves his father's home after an argument about the loan. After the Goodwins are forced to auction nearly all their horses, Jack offers his services to Sally, who does not know he is a Dillon, as a trainer of their last prize horse, \"Bessie's Boy.\" Although she says that they cannot pay him, he offers to train the horse for nothing until the horse wins.||||| During a storm, Sally drives to get a doctor for her ill mother after the phone wires have come down, but a tree falls and blocks the path of her car. She then saddles Bessie's Boy, and despite the objections of Peter, who warns that running the horse on cement will ruin him, she rides off. The horse's legs are injured from the four mile run, and after her mother dies, Sally and Peter are forced to give up the farm. After Sally finds the note from Dillon offering any two-year-old at his farm, she goes to the Dillon farm with Peter, who hates the Dillons. Although Sally wants to take \"Postman,\" who has the appearance of a winner, she defers to Peter's judgment about a \"runt\" horse which, he says, has \"the look of eagles\" in his eye, a look he has seen only a few times before.

Chandler finds the break-up of the two friends particularly stressful as it reminds him of his parents' divorce and he starts to smoke again, to try to relieve his stress. When Ross asks the guys to hang out with him, they have to dismiss the idea of attending a fashion show with Rachel. To get back at him, she invites them over to her sister's cabin for a ski trip, which the guys agree to instead of a LaserDisc weekend marathon playing darts with Ross. The guys leave for the cabin but they have to pull in so that Chandler can go to a restroom. Rachel, however, closes the door of the cab, which has the keys locked inside. After some arguing, Joey gets Phoebe to give him her bra, pulls out the wire and picks the car lock. Everyone is about to leave, but the car runs out of gas.||||| Saddened and alone, Ross seeks solace in Carol and Susan at their apartment. Only Carol's there, so he opens up his heart to her about him and Rachel breaking up, even though Carol has clearly set up a special romantic dinner to celebrate the first time she slept with Susan. Also, Ross tells her an edited version of the story which neglects to mention that he cheated on Rachel, instead casting her as the guilty party for cheating on him with Mark .

Chandler finds the break-up of the two friends particularly stressful as it reminds him of his parents' divorce and he starts to smoke again, to try to relieve his stress. When Ross asks the guys to hang out with him, they have to dismiss the idea of attending a fashion show with Rachel. To get back at him, she invites them over to her sister's cabin for a ski trip, which the guys agree to instead of a LaserDisc weekend marathon playing darts with Ross. The guys leave for the cabin but they have to pull in so that Chandler can go to a restroom. Rachel, however, closes the door of the cab, which has the keys locked inside. After some arguing, Joey gets Phoebe to give him her bra, pulls out the wire and picks the car lock. Everyone is about to leave, but the car runs out of gas.||||| Saddened and alone, Ross seeks solace in Carol and Susan at their apartment. Only Carol's there, so he opens up his heart to her about him and Rachel breaking up, even though Carol has clearly set up a special romantic dinner to celebrate the first time she slept with Susan. Also, Ross tells her an edited version of the story which neglects to mention that he cheated on Rachel, instead casting her as the guilty party for cheating on him with Mark .

As we open Nathan knocks on the door is greeted by Billie Green, doll collector. She takes him into the dining room where her black doll collection is displayed. Billie Green is watching closely as he carefully is examining the dolls. Nathan asks he was seeing. Billie reaches for one specific doll, \"Baby Nancy\" and says that this is the doll that changed the toy industry. Nathan looks at Billie in wonderment with one question, how? Green explains that before this doll other black doll representations were either negative stereotypes such as a Mamie or Uncle Tom, or the mold used was a white doll with brown paint. But this doll, Baby Nancy, she was specifically designed to have black features, natural hair and was modeled after a young black girl in the community of South LA.||||| Green turns the doll over to show the back of the neck, and shows Nathan that it is inscribed with \"Shindana Toys\" and underneath \"Division of Operation Bootstrap\". Green gives the history of Operation Bootstrap and that this organization grew from the Watts uprising by two men in particular, Lou Smith and Robert Hall, bringing training and education to the neighborhood as well as partnering with local organizations and businesses to enhance the neighborhood. Green explains that there was a shift in the community to self-identify and one of the most successful initiatives of Operation Bootstrap, Shindana Toy Company, was pivotal to this for young kids both black and white. Hester explains how the psyche behind Shindana was to give black children a doll that they could identify with as well as to teach children tolerance. The company even marketed the doll to both black and white children to teach them how to relate at a young age.||||| She goes on to explain that the success transformed the doll industry and grew so large that it opened up distribution centers in New York, Chicago, and Houston. Green points out her specific dolls and explains that they reached to celebrities like Flip Wilson and Dr. J. And they even created a \"lil cousins\" brand that which featured multicultural dolls, expanding their brand. Green shares the stories behind her dolls and personal connection behind collecting them. Nathan thanks Billie for her time and heads out.

Nathan sits down at the table researching the folder and seeing what he can find. Nathan is greeted by the owner and librarian at the Library and he explains that he is looking for information on Shindana and Bootstrap. She takes him up to a small research table upstairs surrounded by periodicals and brings out a small file, that reads \"20th Century Organizational Files.\" The librarian explains that there is not much left on it, and most of the stories live with the people that were involved in it. He flips to an article from Business Weekly, 1967. He reads:\n\n\"Operation Bootstrap, an ambitious self-help program in LA, is aiding hundreds of Negroes - once considered all but unemployable - to find jobs. Its program includes vocational training that makes use of $100,000 worth of equipment loaned by such firms as IBM, Singer, Litton Industries, and Scientific Data Systems.\"||||| Most narratives of the aftermath of the Watts Uprising focus on how businesses left the community...but these documents suggest that that's not the whole story, not even close. This is a story about resilience, community strength and economic revival...and outside of the black community in South LA, this story is barely known. Besides coming out of the Watts uprising, how did Operation Bootstrap start? And was a Toy Factory at the heart of it? Nathan takes a few pictures of the Operation Bootstrap documents he made and places his iPad he was taking notes on in his satchel. He puts on his hat and out the door he goes. Nathan then heads to the Dunbar Hotel to meet with Marva Smith and David Crittendon. The wife of the late Lou Smith, who was the co-founder of Operation Bootstrap, and close friend of family and Operation Bootstrap. The location of the organization is less than 300 ft from where Nathan and Marva are sitting now.||||| Smith, Crittendon and Nathan sit drinking coffee and chatting about why Lou started Operation Bootstrap, the black community in Los Angeles reacted to the existential and economic devastation of the 1965 Watts riots. Lou Smith and Robert Hall wanted to give South LA education in vocational jobs as well as remedial studies like English and math. As the conversation continues, Nathan continues to ask questions. His understanding of South Los Angeles after the riots is that businesses fled and the community was left in socioeconomic distress, but he hasn't heard this more positive narrative of self-help organizations like Operation Bootstrap let alone this toy factory! Smith goes on to say that Operation Bootstrap, however, did not just have impact on those within the community. The organization also provided an opportunity for those outside the neighborhood to have open dialogues around race and racism in 1960s Los Angeles. A clip plays from the UCLA documentary \"Sensitivity Sessions.\"||||| Smith tells him that Operation Bootstrap was extremely successful, they trained many individuals throughout the community and opened multiple businesses, and the story of one individual they saw transform before their eyes, Lewis Kiwasi. He was known as the kid in the neighborhood that did not try and did his same thing every day, but really took what Operation Bootstrap did and found a place for his potential and thrived, even to succeed Lou Smith after his passing. She suggests that Nathan sees the Conner Family, three women that thrived from Operation bootstrap, Doris Conner, was the dress designer and maker for Shindana Dolls. Nathan Masters drives up and parks out front of Irie Vibes Art Space. As Nathan arrives, the Conners have tables set up in the same way they would for their weekly sewing classes. Nathan walks into Irie Vibes and is greeted by Doris, Tuesday and Lynne.||||| Nathan meets the Conner Family: Doris Conner and her daughters Tuesday and Lynne, who all worked at the Shindana factory at its height. As Tuesday is teaching Nathan the process of pattern, pinning and sewing, he acknowledges that with the size of the company, their job must have been no small task. He asks about the impact that working for Shindana had for them. They explain that they owe their success as business owners to Shindana and Operation Bootstrap. They pull a doll out and mention, \"just like how this doll transformed the doll industry, it also transformed our lives.\" For the Conner's, and for many children in South LA and beyond, It was about seeing themselves represented in the world. But they make the point that Shindana wasn't just about making black dolls, we made Latino dolls, Asian dolls, etc. It was about equity in representation...and you'd be surprised just how much that can matter in child's life.||||| The Conner's talk about what they do today, design, act, provide a space for the community to come and have a jam session or learn a vocational job, like sewing. Lynne reflects that their mom always taught them that if you could do something with your hands you would never go hungry, From their roots they learned to be part of the community and to give back and that is exactly what they continue to do today at their own shop. The Conner's tell Nathan that Mattel funded and helped get Operation Bootstrap off the ground.||||| Nathan ends his journey at Leimert Park where he meets up with Yolanda Hester, black doll historian. Hester reaffirms the importance Shindana and Operation Bootstrap, and how the toy factory. Nathan asks Hester how Shindana affected the neighborhood and its residents. Nathan reflects that it didn't just impact the kids who owned the dolls, it succeeded in starting a grassroots economic incubator, and the ladies at Irie Vibes. As Hester and Nathan walk through the Leimert Park, they discuss how Operation Bootstrap expanded black ownership and ironically perhaps set the seed for the community's own self-gentrification, a similar characteristic to the neighborhood around them.

Arthur then says \"Well, now Buster 's gone crazy for dinosaurs!\" In Mr. Ratburn 's class, Mr. Ratburn announces that they will be taking a field trip to Rainbow Rock State Park where they will find different kinds of fossils. Buster is so excited that he knocks over his chair. The class arrives at Rainbow Rock State Park. Buster and Arthur arrive with Arthur carrying a heavy load of supplies. The whole class begins playing around until Mr. Ratburn alerts everyone to follow him. They enter the exhibition area and meet up with Ranger Ruth , who will be their fossil-hunting guide. She asks the class what a fossil is and Buster answers in a very scientific manner, much to everyone's surprise.||||| The show begins, and Ranger Ruth explains about life many years ago. How there were different plants, bugs and of course, dinosaurs. She further explains how the animals would die out. During this scene, the back person of the dinosaur costume accidentally falls backwards and runs away. Mr. Ratburn has the laughing class quiet down. Ruth continues and explains how certain parts of the bodies such as bones would last during the rotting time, and how water covered the land and eventually become rock and dirt, thus covering the remains turning them into fossils. After the show, the class heads out to hunt for fossils. On the way, Ruth talks to the children about how certain layers in the cliff date how old a certain fossil is depending on where it's found. Muffy asks how they are going to search in the cliffs, but Ruth says that they will be searching in the water.||||| In excitement, Francine rushes into the water and begins searching. Later that day, all the kids are still searching, with Buster and Arthur not having any luck. Mr. Ratburn notifies them that they will be leaving soon. Buster, in determination, wants to keep looking until they leave. Arthur protests at this, for the other students are having soda for a lunch break, and accidentally picks up a rock, which turns out to be a fossil. Buster notices and goes through a daze. Nervously, Arthur drops the fossil into the water, but Buster jumps after it and begins digging through the rocks rapidly until he finds it. Arthur thinks it's a leaf fossil, but Buster rebukes this and sees that it's a footprint. When the kids are gathered together, Brain shows Ruth a shell fossil and she places it into a sack. Buster notices this and is surprised to see that they don't keep them. Ruth explains to him that they take the fossils to the museum.||||| Buster is upset at this and hides the footprint in his hat. He also pretends that he and Arthur haven't found any fossils. As they leave Arthur tells Buster he should give it up, but Buster doesn't yield and still wants to keep it. Ruth meets up with them, congratulates Buster for being an excellent paleontologist and pats him on the head, where the fossil is. Because they are so nervous, they imagine Ruth as a dinosaur on the way out. On the way home on the bus, Arthur asks if they could tell someone about the fossil, but Buster denies this for he thinks it's too dangerous. When Buster gets home, he wraps the fossil in tinfoil, and stuffs it in a bag in a box of marbles to hide in his closet. At dinner, Buster's Mom asks her son if he found any fossils on the field trip, and he nervously says no.||||| The next day at school, Arthur asks if he can come to see the fossil, but Buster declines this for he thinks someone would see it. Arthur attempts to reason with Buster that there's no point on having the fossil if they can't even see it themselves. Mr. Ratburn enters the classroom, then talks to the class about their field trip and about how rare certain fossils are, especially footprints. In shock, Buster faints and falls backwards on his chair. Later that night, Buster is at home writing on his desk, until there is a pound on the door. After asking who it is, Ruth answers as the \"fossil police\". They then break down the door and the police bring in Arthur, who apologizes to Buster for telling, they tickled him.||||| Ruth believes that Buster is keeping a dinosaur in his room.

Just before going at it with the last wolf, Mississippi vampire king Russell Edgington rides up in hunting garb. He chastises one of the wolves for attacking Bill instead of kidnapping him as ordered. When Russell learns they fed on Bill, he shoots one of the two surviving wolves, and takes Bill back to his home. Lafayette frantically tries to make sure Tara throws up all of the pills she's taken in her suicide attempt. He yells at Lettie Mae for not paying attention to her daughter and takes Tara away with him. Sookie goes to see Eric about helping her find Bill. She shows him the runic brand they found on the dead werewolf. He tells her it's too dangerous for her to go poking around. In the bathroom, Pam is fixing her make-up and Jessica asks her how to feed on humans without killing them. She then wants to know how to dispose of one you've accidentally killed.||||| Sookie gets weepy, talking about Bill being missing, and tells Eric he owes her after she risked her life to help him find Godric. This emotion gets to Eric. As soon as Sookie leaves, Eric has a flashback to the 1940s. He and Godric watch an American soldier attempt to help a woman. She turns into a werewolf and kills the soldier. Eric and Godric jump out and pin the wolf to the wall. She yells that they are on the \"same side.\" When Eric sees the werewolf has one of the brands on her neck he says, \"No, we are not.' Russell brings Bill inside his stately residence. He is introduced to Russell's boyfriend, Talbot, and they show Bill to the luxurious room where he will be confined. On the way to the hospital, Tara assures Lafayette that she puked up all of the pills in her system. He tells her that Eggs \"would want you to live.\" When Tara doesn't seem so sure, Lafayette says he needs to show her something.||||| Sookie leaves Jessica at Bill's place, where Hoyt is waiting on the porch with a few bottles of True Blood. When Hoyt tells Jessica he knows what she was going through, being so hungry, she says he simply does not understand and storms inside crying. Inside she finds her rotting kill still in Bill's secret resting spot and climbs in with the corpse. At home, Sookie is surprised to find Jason. He tells her he's been having trouble sleeping and came over to do some cleaning. As they clean the kitchen Sookie tells Jason about the werewolves and the fact she feels helpless about Bill's disappearance. Jason thinks Andy might be able to help. Sam has fallen asleep at the wheel outside the Mickens residence. He is awakened by Tommy Mickens (who her had followed from the auto repair shop) pointing a shotgun in his face. Tommy brings Sam inside. When Sam tells his mother (Melinda) it's been 34 years since they've met, she knows right away who he is. She gives a look to husband Joe Lee who also seems to understand.||||| Sookie spots a werewolf staring at her from the woods near the bar. He disappears when Terry walks by, and the two search for clues. They find biker shoe prints and wolf prints, followed by a pair of discarded boots. Lafayette takes Tara to an institution. He tells the receptionist he wants to see Ruby Jean Reynolds, his mother. We see her in her room being fed by a young Latino orderly, Jesus. She is seriously delusional. Andy gives a statement to the press as Jason walks up to the station.||||| Andy isn't happy to see him and offers to take Jason out to lunch. Sookie tells Terry not to tell anyone about the man they saw. He gives her a revolver for protection. Sookie suggests he tell Arlene that he's \"good at things.\" Melinda tells Sam that Joe Lee was in prison when she had him. Melinda thought Sam would have a better life with another family. Joe Lee wasn't aware of Sam's existence until he had already been given away to the Merlottes. Sam learns that Melinda and Tommy are shapeshifters, but Joe Lee is not. Joe Lee thinks being a shapeshifter is \"special,\" but Sam assures him it has meant he's been alone all his life.||||| Lafayette tells Tara that Ruby has been a patient there for six months. She made him promise not to tell anyone. Lafayette showed her Ruby because \"there is darkness in this family.\" He thinks they are strong enough to rise above their suspect gene pool. Outside, Tommy and Sam compare notes for who had a more miserable life. Tommy wishes he had been sent away since Sam doesn't know what it was like to grow up with Melinda and Joe Lee. Eventually, they decide to go for a run and we see that Tommy shifts into a pit bull. Jessica calls about renting a chainsaw. She looks in her victim's wallet and sees a picture of him with a boy. She grabs his cash and leaves. Bill sits down to a formal dinner with King Russell and Talbot. Russell offers him a job as Sheriff of one of Mississippi's areas and says he is interested in marrying Queen Sophie to increase his kingdom. Sophie so far is refusing, and Russell would like Bill's help.||||| As Andy and Jason sit at Merlotte's, a glowing story about Andy comes on the TV. A drunken Jason stands up and toasts Andy. Jason seems upset that Andy is being treated like a hero for taking credit for his killing. Andy tells Jason he thinks he has potential. Jason tells Andy he is his best friend. During their run, Tommy stops in the middle of the road and barks at Sam. With a truck approaching, Sam runs over to Tommy.||||| Just before the truck runs them both over, Tommy turns into an owl and flies off. Sam misses being killed by inches and returns to his human shape, naked on the side of the road. An unseen man wearing boots rummages through drawers at Bill's house (?) and finds a hidden file on Sookie. Eric arrives at Sookie's place. Sitting on the porch, he tells her he and Godric found out back in the 1940s that the werewolves' master was a vampire. They had been hunting the pack of wolves, which are \"not ordinary werewolves\" and date back further than the Nazi party. The lycanthropes were well-trained and fueled by vampire blood. With Sookie in danger, Eric feels like he owes her. Eric wants her to invite him inside but she refuses.||||| Russell feels he has outgrown Mississippi and is interested in Louisiana's natural gas. Russell is aware Sophie has secrets and wants Bill to tell him what they are. When Bill refuses, Russell makes a threat towards Sookie. Terry reads Arlene a list of his positive qualities. A few moments in, she runs back to the bathroom to vomit. A dark figure enters Merlotte's and sits at the bar. He strikes up a conversation with Tara and orders a True Blood. His boots show that this is the man who was looking at Sookie's file. Jessica returns home to find her victim is missing. Andy drives Jason home from the bar. He gets a call that a meth lab is being busted in Hotshot, and takes Jason along.||||| At the scene Jason spots a strange woman in the woods. He asks if she is okay and she disappears. Jason walks back to the car and ends up tackling one of the drug dealers. Tara chugs bourbon outside the bar. When two unruly and drunken men try to urinate on the spot Eggs was killed, she attacks them. The vampire from earlier appears and helps her out, demanding the men apologize. During the dessert course, Russell mentions being aware that Bill has killed for Sookie in the past. At this point, Bill's maker, Lorena, appears. Bill tosses an oil lamp at her head, and she falls to the ground with the upper portion of her body covered in flames. Eric senses something and demands Sookie invite him inside. She does and he ends up face-to-face with a wolf. Eric's fangs come out and the wolf takes a run at him.

Sitting on the porch, he tells her he and Godric found out back in the 1940s that the werewolves' master was a vampire. They had been hunting the pack of wolves, which are \"not ordinary werewolves\" and date back further than the Nazi party. The lycanthropes were well-trained and fueled by vampire blood. With Sookie in danger, Eric feels like he owes her. Eric wants her to invite him inside but she refuses.||||| Russell feels he has outgrown Mississippi and is interested in Louisiana's natural gas. Russell is aware Sophie has secrets and wants Bill to tell him what they are. When Bill refuses, Russell makes a threat towards Sookie. Terry reads Arlene a list of his positive qualities. A few moments in, she runs back to the bathroom to vomit. A dark figure enters Merlotte's and sits at the bar. He strikes up a conversation with Tara and orders a True Blood. His boots show that this is the man who was looking at Sookie's file. Jessica returns home to find her victim is missing. Andy drives Jason home from the bar. He gets a call that a meth lab is being busted in Hotshot, and takes Jason along.||||| At the scene Jason spots a strange woman in the woods. He asks if she is okay and she disappears. Jason walks back to the car and ends up tackling one of the drug dealers. Tara chugs bourbon outside the bar. When two unruly and drunken men try to urinate on the spot Eggs was killed, she attacks them. The vampire from earlier appears and helps her out, demanding the men apologize. During the dessert course, Russell mentions being aware that Bill has killed for Sookie in the past. At this point, Bill's maker, Lorena, appears. Bill tosses an oil lamp at her head, and she falls to the ground with the upper portion of her body covered in flames. Eric senses something and demands Sookie invite him inside. She does and he ends up face-to-face with a wolf. Eric's fangs come out and the wolf takes a run at him. Sookie fires a shot from the revolver as the episode ends.", "row": 70, "response": "Here are the main concepts identified using the 5 W's, 1 H retell strategy:\n\n**Who:**\n\n* Bill Compton\n* Russell Edgington (Mississippi vampire king)\n* Sookie Stackhouse\n* Eric Northman\n* Lafayette Reynolds\n* Tara Thornton\n* Jessica Hamby\n* Hoyt Fortenberry\n* Jason Stackhouse\n* Sam Merlotte\n* Tommy Mickens\n* Melinda Mickens\n* Joe Lee Mickens\n* Andy Bellefleur\n* Pam Swynford De Beaufort\n* Godric\n* Lorena (Bill's maker)\n* Talbot (Russell's boyfriend)\n* Queen Sophie\n* Ruby Jean Reynolds (Lafayette's mother)\n* Jesus (Latino orderly)\n* Arlene Fowler\n* Lettie Mae Thornton (Tara's mother)\n\n**What:**\n\n* Werewolves attacking Bill\n* Russell Edgington's plan to marry Queen Sophie\n* Bill being taken to Russell's residence\n* Lafayette trying to save Tara from suicide\n* Sookie seeking Eric's help to find Bill\n* Eric's flashback to the 1940s\n* Jessica learning to feed on humans without killing them\n* Sam discovering his shapeshifting family\n* Tara's struggles with her past\n* Jason's feelings of helplessness\n* Andy's heroism being questioned\n* Russell's interest in Louisiana's natural gas\n\n**When:**\n\n* The present day (no specific date or time mentioned)\n* The 1940s (Eric's flashback)\n\n**Where:**\n\n* Bon Temps, Louisiana\n* Mississippi (Russell Edgington's kingdom)\n* Hotshot, Louisiana (meth lab bust)\n\n**Why:**\n\n* Russell Edgington wants to marry Queen Sophie to increase his kingdom\n* Bill is being held captive by Russell Edgington\n* Sookie wants to find Bill and rescue him\n* Lafayette wants to help Tara overcome her past\n* Eric feels obligated to help Sookie due to their past experiences\n* Russell Edgington is interested in Louisiana's natural gas\n\n**How:**\n\n* Bill fights off werewolves\n* Russell Edgington uses his vampire powers to control the situation\n* Lafayette uses his quick thinking to save Tara\n* Eric uses his vampire strength to subdue the werewolf\n* Sam discovers his shapeshifting abilities\n* Jessica learns to feed on humans without killing them from Pam\n* Russell Edgington uses his influence to manipulate others", "decomposed_mcs": ["Here is the list of main concepts in plain text format.", "Bill Compton", "Russell Edgington", "Sookie Stackhouse", "Eric Northman", "Lafayette Reynolds", "Tara Thornton", "Jessica Hamby.", "Hoyt Fortenberry", "Jason Stackhouse", "Sam Merlotte.", "Tommy Mickens", "Melinda Mickens", "Joe Lee Mickens", "Andy Bellefleur", "Pam Swynford De Beaufort", "Godric", "Lorena", "Talbot", "Queen Sophie", "Ruby Jean Reynolds", "Jesus", "Arlene Fowler", "Lettie Mae Thornton", "Werewolves attacking Bill", "Russell Edgington's plan was to marry Queen Sophie.", "Bill was taken to Russell's residence.", "Lafayette tried to save Tara from suicide.", "Sookie seeks Eric's help.", "Sookie seeks Eric's help to find Bill.", "Eric's flashback was to the 1940s.", "Jessica is learning to feed on humans.", "Jessica is learning to feed on humans without killing them.", "Sam discovered his shapeshifting family.", "Tara's struggles with her past", "Jason's feelings of helplessness", "Andy's heroism is being questioned.", "Russell's interest in Louisiana's natural gas", "The present day", "The 1940s", "Bon Temps Louisiana", "Mississippi", "Hotshot Louisiana", "Russell Edgington wants to marry Queen Sophie.", "Russell Edgington wants to increase his kingdom.", "Bill is being held captive by Russell Edgington", "Sookie wants to find Bill.", "Sookie wants to rescue him.", "Lafayette wants to help Tara.", "Lafayette wants to help Tara overcome her past.", "Eric feels obligated to help Sookie.", "Eric feels obligated to help Sookie due to their past experiences.", "Russell Edgington is interested in Louisiana's natural gas.", "Bill fights off werewolves", "Russell Edgington uses his vampire powers to control the situation.", "Lafayette uses his quick thinking to save Tara.", "Eric uses his vampire strength to subdue the werewolf.", "Sam discovers his shapeshifting abilities", "Jessica learns to feed on humans without killing them from Pam.", "Russell Edgington uses his influence to manipulate others."]}

Buzz (Dean Cain), a former soldier, is shown holstering handguns in his tuxedo, Teddy (Andy Dick), a browbeaten house husband, is meticulously getting ready, Sol (Mitchell Whitfield), a former criminal lawyer now specializing in divorce, dresses neatly while Billy (Sean Patrick Flannery), a failing actor, is shown watching a newscast. The reporter goes into detail about a recent bank robbery where the robber recited Shakespearean prose before escaping. All four of the guys then meet up and walk towards a prison where it is shown that Jesse (Luke Wilson) is being released after spending 3 years for an unspecified crime.||||| During a heated argument between Sol and Jesse it is hinted that Sol was Jesse's attorney and made an error that led to Jesse's incarceration. Jesse is the groom and upon his release has planned to meet his fiance Hope (Drew Barrymore) and marry her surrounded by his best friends. While en route to the wedding ceremony Billy asks for the guys to pull over near a bank. Billy enters the bank wearing a balaclava and commences to rob it (showing that he is the Shakespeare robber from the earlier newscast). As he finishes, he gives a rendition of Shakespeare just as Buzz walks in trying to get Billy to hurry up. Buzz stops the robbery but unveils Billy to everyone as the robber. The other guys then walk into the bank and inadvertently create a hostage situation. The police are called and the guys are faced with the consequences of Billy's actions. Sol tells them they are all accomplices and facing serious prison time.||||| However, the bank customers bond with the 5 unlikely robbers. Outside the bank Billy's dad, Sheriff Philips (Fred Ward), demands for Billy to surrender and mocks him for being a failure in life. Billy confronts his father and refuses to surrender. Inside the bank it's suggested that Billy release some of the hostages and Mayor Boar (Bill Yeager) volunteers but is mocked for being cowardly. One of the hostages, Gonzo (Brad Dourif) comes forward and offers the guys a solution to their problem. He suggests they request a chopper land on the roof and he will fly them to safety. Buzz seems to bond with Gonzo who is a Vietnam veteran, Buzz tells Gonzo that his whole dream in life was to serve in the military but due to being gay he was not allowed to serve. Gonzo seeing his pain, gifts Buzz his military jacket. Outside the FBI arrive to take over the hostage negotiation.||||| The lead agent Hoover (Raymond J. Barry) shows little regard for the hostages and plans to execute the five dimwitted robbers as soon as they exit the bank. Sheriff Philips approaches the bank and Billy finally confronts his father for being a lousy parent. The sheriff is shown to realise he was never there for his son. Billy agrees to allow some of the hostages to go, Gonzo amongst them. All of the freed hostages refuse to identify Billy or his friends. The gang negotiates for Jesse and Hope to be married in the bank and Hoover agrees for a priest to go in and perform the ceremony. During the wedding, the priest is uncovered to be a federal agent and Teddy and Buzz are shot during a struggle. Teddy, feeling like the bank robbery has woken him up, refuses to be sent to hospital for urgent care but eventually acquiesces.

Buzz (Dean Cain), a former soldier, is shown holstering handguns in his tuxedo, Teddy (Andy Dick), a browbeaten house husband, is meticulously getting ready, Sol (Mitchell Whitfield), a former criminal lawyer now specializing in divorce, dresses neatly while Billy (Sean Patrick Flannery), a failing actor, is shown watching a newscast. The reporter goes into detail about a recent bank robbery where the robber recited Shakespearean prose before escaping. All four of the guys then meet up and walk towards a prison where it is shown that Jesse (Luke Wilson) is being released after spending 3 years for an unspecified crime.||||| During a heated argument between Sol and Jesse it is hinted that Sol was Jesse's attorney and made an error that led to Jesse's incarceration. Jesse is the groom and upon his release has planned to meet his fiance Hope (Drew Barrymore) and marry her surrounded by his best friends. While en route to the wedding ceremony Billy asks for the guys to pull over near a bank. Billy enters the bank wearing a balaclava and commences to rob it (showing that he is the Shakespeare robber from the earlier newscast). As he finishes, he gives a rendition of Shakespeare just as Buzz walks in trying to get Billy to hurry up. Buzz stops the robbery but unveils Billy to everyone as the robber. The other guys then walk into the bank and inadvertently create a hostage situation. The police are called and the guys are faced with the consequences of Billy's actions. Sol tells them they are all accomplices and facing serious prison time.||||| However, the bank customers bond with the 5 unlikely robbers. Outside the bank Billy's dad, Sheriff Philips (Fred Ward), demands for Billy to surrender and mocks him for being a failure in life. Billy confronts his father and refuses to surrender. Inside the bank it's suggested that Billy release some of the hostages and Mayor Boar (Bill Yeager) volunteers but is mocked for being cowardly. One of the hostages, Gonzo (Brad Dourif) comes forward and offers the guys a solution to their problem. He suggests they request a chopper land on the roof and he will fly them to safety. Buzz seems to bond with Gonzo who is a Vietnam veteran, Buzz tells Gonzo that his whole dream in life was to serve in the military but due to being gay he was not allowed to serve. Gonzo seeing his pain, gifts Buzz his military jacket. Outside the FBI arrive to take over the hostage negotiation.||||| The lead agent Hoover (Raymond J. Barry) shows little regard for the hostages and plans to execute the five dimwitted robbers as soon as they exit the bank. Sheriff Philips approaches the bank and Billy finally confronts his father for being a lousy parent. The sheriff is shown to realise he was never there for his son. Billy agrees to allow some of the hostages to go, Gonzo amongst them. All of the freed hostages refuse to identify Billy or his friends. The gang negotiates for Jesse and Hope to be married in the bank and Hoover agrees for a priest to go in and perform the ceremony. During the wedding, the priest is uncovered to be a federal agent and Teddy and Buzz are shot during a struggle. Teddy, feeling like the bank robbery has woken him up, refuses to be sent to hospital for urgent care but eventually acquiesces. Buzz patches his wound and the guys plot their exit from the bank.||||| Sol goes outside and negotiates a deal with Hoover to get everyone out. As Sol re-enters the bank, Hoover informs his men that the guys will never escape and that as soon as they exit he will have his snipers gun them down. Sol and the guys with the remaining hostages exit the bank draped in a giant American flag.

She puts on her cheerleader outfit and goes downstairs to breakfast -- Jenna and her mom are there. It's sophomore year. She wakes up in the hospital. Meredith tells Jeremy that Elena is fine, she just has a slight concussion. Jeremy calls the Salvatores on the road. They can't believe Jeremy took her to the hospital when all the originals are looking to kill her to stop Alaric. One of them has to go back; the other has to deal with Klaus's desiccated body. Meredith returns to her office to find Alaric waiting for her. He takes her vials of vampire blood and dumps them out. He's reporting her to the medical board and Sheriff Forbes and Mayor Lockwood have been relieved of their duties. He wants Elena released into his custody. He goes to her room but finds she's gone.||||| Caroline, Matt and Tyler bring Elena home. Elena remembers sophomore year when she was with Matt. Bonnie has a bad feeling about the bonfire tonight. Jenna's in town and Elena's parents want to do family night. Matt tells her he loves her and Bonnie notices she doesn't say it back. She tells Elena not to string him along. Elena wakes up to Matt sitting watch. Tyler and Caroline got calls from their moms.||||| Elena apologizes to him for stringing him along and says she can't do the same thing to Damon and Stefan. Stefan comes in. Jeremy goes to pick up food at the Grille. Alaric finds him. Matt questions the wisdom of not getting Elena out of town, but Stefan is letting her decide what she wants to do. Elena goes to the door -- Elijah is there. At the Grille, Alaric asks Jeremy where Klaus' body is. Alaric wants Jeremy's help to find him and kill him to get rid of vampires. Once he's done, Alaric suggests they can put a spell on him so that Elena will be able to live out the rest of her life. The stake he has is the only thing that can kill them.||||| Elijah proposes he get the stake and his family will scatter for the rest of her life, prompting Alaric to follow them. He also wants Klaus' body and gives her his word he won't revive him within her or her children's lifetimes. They debate whether to trust him. Damon weighs in via speakerphone, firmly against the deal. Stefan defers to Elena. Elijah just wants his brother back. Elena agrees. Matt and Caroline go to the Lockwoods where their moms tell them Alaric outed them to the council. They want them to run. Jeremy tells Matt about Alaric's proposal. Jeremy doesn't know where Klaus' body is, but Matt does. Jeremy calls Alaric and tells him Damon's taking him to bury him in the woods. Jeremy gets off the phone and we see everyone is in the room with him. He reports that Alaric bought it. Tyler thinks they should go and Caroline is willing to run with him, but she wants to help their friends first. They make plans to meet in two hours.||||| Damon meets up with Bonnie, irked that Elena sold their souls to the originals. \"You know what else was her call? Everything bad, ever,\" he says. Damon has him in a coffin in a storage facility. Bonnie's there to put a spell on him so Alaric can't find him with a witch. Bonnie asks for a moment alone with him. Klaus is conscious, but can't talk. She hates him for turning almost everyone she knows. Elena worries about Jeremy and Stefan assures her he'll be fine. Elena starts to say something else, but tells him they can talk later. He thinks about it then goes back and kisses her. \"That's just in case there is no 'later,'\" he says. Damon hangs out with the body, waiting for Rebekah to come get him. Caroline and Elijah are in place; Jeremy's going to lead Alaric to them. Damon can't believe Stefan let Elena decide.||||| Damon hears someone coming and thinks it's Rebekah. But instead Alaric grabs him around the throat. \"You'd be surprised how competent law enforcement is when it isn't corrupted by vampires,\" he says. He asks where Klaus is. Damon wishes him luck finding him in the thousands of storage lockers. Alaric snaps Damon's neck. Matt brings Elena tea. It tastes funny, he blames it on honey. \"So, Stefan?\" Matt says. Elena tells Matt, for the first time, that Stefan saved her life when her parents' car went over the bridge. Being with Stefan helped her sort through everything after they died. She says you should love the person who makes you glad to be alive, but when she's with Damon, he consumes her. She doesn't want to chose one and lose the other. She wishes her mom was there to give her advice. Back to sophomore year, Elena calls home for a ride home from the bonfire. She tells her mom about getting in a fight with Matt because he brought up marriage and college. She doesn't want to lose Matt by being honest about her feelings, but her mom says she'd be setting him free.||||| Elena wakes up in a moving car. Matt drugged her and is taking her out of town. Alaric goes searching through storage lockers. Rebekah arrives. She goes walking among the storage lockers calling for Damon. Suddenly a hand clamps around her mouth. Damon shushes her. Alaric comes to the 1020 locker the coffin was in. He opens it. The coffin isn't there. Rebekah and Damon wheel the coffin out but don't get far before they fun into Alaric. He grabs Rebekah and slams her face off a car. She goes down. Damon attacks but he kicks him to the ground. With Rebekah and Damon both down for the count, Alaric opens Klaus' coffin. He stakes Klaus. Damon holds Rebekah back as she screams. Klaus bursts into flames. Damon tells her to run. He tries to take on Alaric, but Alaric swats him away. Later, Damon calls Stefan. They both feel OK. They figure they have about an hour if Klaus was telling the truth. Stefan says an hour isn't long enough for Damon to make it back to Mystic Falls -- to see Elena. He thinks she made her choice.||||| Jeremy confesses that Elena isn't in Mystic Falls. Elijah and Caroline show up. Matt gets a call about the news. Elena wants to go back, but Matt tells her Damon isn't with them. She has to pick which way to go. Elena calls Damon, who still feels fine. She tells him Matt's taking her home -- to Stefan, Tyler and Caroline. Damon asks her who she'd pick between him and Stefan. She loves Stefan and whatever she feels for Damon, she can't change how she feels about Stefan. She says maybe if she'd met Damon first.... She has to let Damon go, but he'll be fine and see him soon. Damon turns around and sees Alaric standing there. He calmly says good-bye to her. Alaric punches him. Caroline races to the cellar and meets Tyler. She's sobbing and crying and breaks the news to him about Klaus. He tells she'll be fine and to tell his mother that he left town like he was supposed to.||||| He's holding on to her as he starts coughing and is gripped with pain. Caroline feels fine. He wants her to leave so she doesn't see him die, he starts to turn into a werewolf and runs her off. Elena gets the call about Tyler. Matt takes it hard. Rebekah meets Elijah in the woods. Rebekah is sure that Klaus turned that bloodline, so they don't understand how everyone else is still alive. Bonnie goes down to the cellar looking for someone. Tyler walks out, fine. \"I must say you really did that spell brilliantly, I didn't think you had it in you,\" he says. \"I did it to save my friends and my mother, Klaus,\" she says. (Klaus!) Rebekah calls Stefan, since Klaus is dead, their deal is off. She doesn't want to keep running. The only way to stop Alaric is for Elena to die. Cut to Elena and Matt driving back into town over the Wickery Bridge. Rebekah stands in their path. Matt serves to avoid her and they go off the bridge into the river.||||| Elena wakes up in sophomore year, with her dad in the front seat. He tells her they're going to be fine, right as she sinks underwater. Alaric beats up on Damon, who refuses to fight back. Alaric thinks his friendship with Damon made him weak. Damon remembers that same bonfire night, seeing Elena on the phone. He goes over and talks to her, thinking she's Katherine. She tells him she got into a fight with her boyfriend over the future. He says she knows what she wants, a love that consumes her, passion, adventure and even a little danger. She asks what he wants, but her parents drive up. He compels her to forget they ever met, saying he can't have people know he's in town yet. Alaric continues beating on Damon and then kneels down with his stake. He starts to drive it in, but Damon fights back. Elena wakes up in the car underwater. She remembers the last time she was there with her parents as she struggles to wake Matt up and break the window.||||| She mouthed \"I love you\" to her dad underwater and passed out. Stefan swam down and her dad pointed at her for Stefan to save her first. In the present, Stefan swims down again and Elena points at Matt for Stefan to save him first. He resists but she's insistent. Stefan swims away with Matt leaving Elena underwater. Damon is fighting Alaric when suddenly Alaric grabs at his chest, weak. He starts to turn grey. Damon realizes what's happened and holds on to him.||||| Jeremy leaves a message for Matt and comes downstairs to see Alaric standing there. It's good Ric. He wanted to say good-bye and there he was. He tells Jeremy he'll never be alone. Jeremy realizes Alaric is a ghost. But then that means Elena.... Cut to Elena, dead. Stefan cries over her. Damon races in to the hospital. Meredith stops him. She tells him when Jeremy brought her in earlier her injuries were much worse than she let on. Elena had a cerebral hemorrhage. \"I helped her, she needed my help,\" Meredith says pointedly. \"You what?!\" Damon says. Damon realizes what Meredith is saying. Elena had vampire blood in her system. And then she died.

He says she knows what she wants, a love that consumes her, passion, adventure and even a little danger. She asks what he wants, but her parents drive up. He compels her to forget they ever met, saying he can't have people know he's in town yet. Alaric continues beating on Damon and then kneels down with his stake. He starts to drive it in, but Damon fights back. Elena wakes up in the car underwater. She remembers the last time she was there with her parents as she struggles to wake Matt up and break the window.||||| She mouthed \"I love you\" to her dad underwater and passed out. Stefan swam down and her dad pointed at her for Stefan to save her first. In the present, Stefan swims down again and Elena points at Matt for Stefan to save him first. He resists but she's insistent. Stefan swims away with Matt leaving Elena underwater. Damon is fighting Alaric when suddenly Alaric grabs at his chest, weak. He starts to turn grey. Damon realizes what's happened and holds on to him.||||| Jeremy leaves a message for Matt and comes downstairs to see Alaric standing there. It's good Ric. He wanted to say good-bye and there he was. He tells Jeremy he'll never be alone. Jeremy realizes Alaric is a ghost. But then that means Elena.... Cut to Elena, dead. Stefan cries over her. Damon races in to the hospital. Meredith stops him. She tells him when Jeremy brought her in earlier her injuries were much worse than she let on. Elena had a cerebral hemorrhage. \"I helped her, she needed my help,\" Meredith says pointedly. \"You what?!\" Damon says. Damon realizes what Meredith is saying. Elena had vampire blood in her system. And then she died.

Jessica denies the allegations that she is any negative influence over her husband, while Pike makes a phone cal to the house to talk with Ernest Valdemar, who speaks over the phone in a weak but coherent voice explaining about his decision to let Jessica take control of his money and assets from his personal signature on the written documents that she has. Pike reluctantly agress to let Jessica have access to the money, but wearns her that if antything were to happen of Mr. Valdemar within the next three before the transfer of his estate over to Jessica is finalized, she will be investigated by the authorities.||||| Jessica returns home to Ernest Valdemar's large suburban mansion where she meets with Dr. Robert Hoffman where it is revealed that he and Jessica have been conspiring to cheat the terminally ill Mr. Valdemar out of his estate hypnotining him and and having him do what they wish from his deathbed. Jessica dosen't like the procedure, but Robert wants it done because he used to have a romance with Jessica and wants to run off with her after they acquire his $3 million assets. The next day, Jessica goes to a bank where she withdraws $3000,000 and stores it in a safe. Robert sees this. But then, Mr. Valdemar goes into cardiac arrest and dies while under another hypnosis spell. Not wanting to reveal his death just yet, Robert and Jessica carry his body to the basement where they hide it in a freezer. But during the night, Jessica becomes frightened when she hears moaning coming from the basement, but when she tries to wake up Robert, he has put himself under a hypnotic-induced slumber to help him sleep.||||| The next morning, Jessica and Robert wake up and also hear the same noises coming from the basement. Upon checking body, they hear Ernest Valdemar's voice coming from the still body claiming that this soul is alive and trapped in a dark void between the living and the dead while under hypnosis. Vlaldemar tells them that he sees \"others\" in the dark void looking at him.||||| While Jessica goes out to make sense of this situation, she returns to find Robert talking to Mr. Valdemar's undead corpse who tells him that the \"other\" are vengeful spirits trapped in a realm and want to use him to enter our world. Valdemar tells Robert to wake him up and free him from his hypnotic state. In a panic, Jessica shoots Valdemar's corpse and wants to bury the body and skip town with the money they have. While Robert heads outside to dig a hole to bury the body, Jessica goes back into the cellar only to find Valdemar's body rising up out of the freezer and walking towards her saying that he is under control of \"the others\" to use him. Jessica shoots him, but he keepson coming. Robert enters the house when he hears the gunshots and sees Jessica and Valdemar struggling on the balcony where the undead walking cadaver shoots Jessica in the head and she falls off the balcony, dead.||||| Robert finally tells Valdemar that he's going to wake him and free from his hypnosis. But after doing so by counting to five, Valdemar tells Robert that it's too late to wake him, for without his body as a conduit, the Others cannot return to their realm. \"They're with you now!\" exclaims Valdemar, who finally falls dead. Robert then steals all the cash that Jessica had stored in the safe and flees the house.||||| Robert goes back to his apartment in downtown Pittsburgh, where he puts himself under a hypnotic sleep. Shortly after, the ghostly \"Others\" enter his apartment and kill him by shoving the hypnotic digital counter into his chest. The ghosts then form themselves into one large mass-like mist and enter Robert's dead body. Several days later, the police led by Detective Grogan arrive at Robert's apartment to answer complaints about a \"strange smell\" and constant moaning coming from the apartment.

Jessica denies the allegations that she is any negative influence over her husband, while Pike makes a phone cal to the house to talk with Ernest Valdemar, who speaks over the phone in a weak but coherent voice explaining about his decision to let Jessica take control of his money and assets from his personal signature on the written documents that she has. Pike reluctantly agress to let Jessica have access to the money, but wearns her that if antything were to happen of Mr. Valdemar within the next three before the transfer of his estate over to Jessica is finalized, she will be investigated by the authorities.||||| Jessica returns home to Ernest Valdemar's large suburban mansion where she meets with Dr. Robert Hoffman where it is revealed that he and Jessica have been conspiring to cheat the terminally ill Mr. Valdemar out of his estate hypnotining him and and having him do what they wish from his deathbed. Jessica dosen't like the procedure, but Robert wants it done because he used to have a romance with Jessica and wants to run off with her after they acquire his $3 million assets. The next day, Jessica goes to a bank where she withdraws $3000,000 and stores it in a safe. Robert sees this. But then, Mr. Valdemar goes into cardiac arrest and dies while under another hypnosis spell. Not wanting to reveal his death just yet, Robert and Jessica carry his body to the basement where they hide it in a freezer. But during the night, Jessica becomes frightened when she hears moaning coming from the basement, but when she tries to wake up Robert, he has put himself under a hypnotic-induced slumber to help him sleep.||||| The next morning, Jessica and Robert wake up and also hear the same noises coming from the basement. Upon checking body, they hear Ernest Valdemar's voice coming from the still body claiming that this soul is alive and trapped in a dark void between the living and the dead while under hypnosis. Vlaldemar tells them that he sees \"others\" in the dark void looking at him.||||| While Jessica goes out to make sense of this situation, she returns to find Robert talking to Mr. Valdemar's undead corpse who tells him that the \"other\" are vengeful spirits trapped in a realm and want to use him to enter our world. Valdemar tells Robert to wake him up and free him from his hypnotic state. In a panic, Jessica shoots Valdemar's corpse and wants to bury the body and skip town with the money they have. While Robert heads outside to dig a hole to bury the body, Jessica goes back into the cellar only to find Valdemar's body rising up out of the freezer and walking towards her saying that he is under control of \"the others\" to use him. Jessica shoots him, but he keepson coming. Robert enters the house when he hears the gunshots and sees Jessica and Valdemar struggling on the balcony where the undead walking cadaver shoots Jessica in the head and she falls off the balcony, dead.||||| Robert finally tells Valdemar that he's going to wake him and free from his hypnosis. But after doing so by counting to five, Valdemar tells Robert that it's too late to wake him, for without his body as a conduit, the Others cannot return to their realm. \"They're with you now!\" exclaims Valdemar, who finally falls dead. Robert then steals all the cash that Jessica had stored in the safe and flees the house.||||| Robert goes back to his apartment in downtown Pittsburgh, where he puts himself under a hypnotic sleep. Shortly after, the ghostly \"Others\" enter his apartment and kill him by shoving the hypnotic digital counter into his chest. The ghosts then form themselves into one large mass-like mist and enter Robert's dead body. Several days later, the police led by Detective Grogan arrive at Robert's apartment to answer complaints about a \"strange smell\" and constant moaning coming from the apartment.

Xander goofs around pretending to be a pirate, Dawn looks for stuff to take, Anya roller-skates around selling things, while Willow argues with a woman who is dressed as a stereotypical witch . Buffy runs into Spike in the basement, and the two have an awkward conversation in which Buffy thinks Spike is trying to get her into bed, but then he clarifies that he wants to go patrolling with her that night, notwithstanding the fact that supernatural forces typically don't operate on Halloween. The gang, who have been helping out all day, are worn out. Anya dances with Dawn as she counts her money. Xander looks at her, and decides that the time has finally arrived to announce that he and Anya are engaged. The gang wishes the couple well but privately share their concerns with each other. As Anya gushes about wedding plans and being married, Xander starts to look uncomfortable.||||| The gang throws an impromptu party at Buffy's house for the two. When the lack of decorations is mentioned, Willow uses a spell to fill the room with them. While Anya is grateful, Tara and Giles share a concerned look.. Later in the kitchen Tara tries to talk to Willow about her casual and increasingly excessive use of magic, while Willow fails to see anything wrong with doing so. Dawn reminds Buffy that she is spending the night at her friend Janice 's house. After Buffy approves, Dawn heads out to meet Janice for what is actually planned to be an evening of Halloween fun and teenage hijinks with two older boys named Zack and Justin. As Dawn, Janice, Zack, and Justin engage in some of the more violent Halloween pranks, breaking windows and damaging mailboxes, back at Buffy's place, Giles and Xander share a drink and talk about Xander's future. Xander almost seems to second-guess his marriage intentions and his future. Giles assures him that everything will be fine.||||| Dawn and friends find themselves in front of Old Man Kaltenbach 's house, Kaltenbach being reclusive and subject to rumor. After Janice refuses to approach the house, Dawn then bravely volunteers. As she lifts his pumpkin to smash it, the old man grabs her. Dawn's pals quickly rush her aid, but they are cheerily invited into the house. As it turns out, the man was actually a toy maker who is merely bitter about his toys becoming obsolete. Justin offers to help the old man with his special treat in the kitchen. As he prepares rice crispy treats for the kids, Justin vamps out, kills the old man, and steals his wallet. Zach and Justin debate whether to just eat Janice and Dawn, or turn them into vampires, too. Justin gives Dawn $10--her portion of the money stolen from Kaltenbach, which she accepts without hesitation.

Janice and Zack then take off, leaving Dawn and Justin alone in the car. Justin then takes the opportunity to make his move and deliver Dawn her very first kiss. At the Bronze, Tara and Willow get into a fight when Willow proposes to magically shift everyone who isn't a 15 year old girl old into an alternate dimension to make Dawn easier to find. After Tara calls Willow out, Willow gets very angry and accuses Tara of taking Giles's side. In Zack's stolen car, Dawn and Justin continue to make out. However, after Justin nibbles her lip a little too hard, he vamps out. Although Dawn is swept away in the moment, she manages to feel his lumpy noggin.

Buffy grabs a pistol crossbow out of his weapons chest.||||| In the cemetery, Giles hears a girl scream and races to save her, thinking it's Dawn. Instead, he finds Zack and Janice, just as Zack pulls his teeth out of her neck. Zack calls Giles \"grandpa\" and tells him Janice was asking for it. The Watcher scoffs that he's certain she was not, and then dusts him. He continues to look for Dawn. Meanwhile, Dawn has just run out of the car to get away from the vampire. He stops her, telling her in an unconvincing monotone that she's different from other girls; he could tell when he first met her that she was special.

Inside, Quarles explains that Tanner is a \"talent scout\" -- and has scouted Devil, who isn't exactly thrilled with how Boyd has treated him. \"You got something better?\" Devil asks. Quarles assures Devil that, yes, he does, and promises him a one-time only offer of improving his standard of living. In the prison yard, Dickie and Dewey are taking severe beatings at the hands of their fellow inmates. Moments later, they are taken to the infirmary, where corrupt guard Ash Murphy rages. Dewey wasn't supposed to be part of this \"plan.\" Lance ( Clayne Crawford ), the prison medic who is also in on the escape plan, jabs Dewey in the neck with a needle. Dewey goes limp. Problem solved... for now.||||| Later, Givens arrives at the prison to question Lance, who explains that he was injured when Dickie escaped in a coroner's van. The van is parked on the side of a rural road as Ash approaches driver Edward Fowler ( Ethan Wilde )... and shoots him dead where he sits. He then opens the back of the van to reveal the body bags containing Dickie, Dewey and an actual deceased inmate. Ash explains that he and Dickie will go after Mags' money while Dewey goes with Lance to hide out at a nearby motel.||||| Neither escapee is overly pleased. Givens then visits Loretta ( Kaitlyn Dever ), who notes that she has a few friends in her new life as a babysitter. After some banter, Givens asks about Mags' stash of money. Loretta thinks she might know where ol' Mags might just have kept that stash. Later, following Loretta's tip, Givens and Rachel arrive at Limehouse's enclave looking for Dickie, who they suspect is after his mom's money. The pair spar with Limehouse, who isn't about to give up any information. He does, however, invite the Marshals to a barbeque. \"I'm going to hook you up with some bacon you ain't never going to forget,\" Limehouse coos to Rachel, who is unimpressed.||||| Givens drives away... and is spotted by Dickie and Ash, who are parked nearby waiting to get past the police check point to the bridge into Limehouse's holler. Ash is furious to see the law, but Dickie doesn't appear to be too terribly surprised. Ash directs that, if they can't approach Limehouse directly, then Dickie will have to find a way to get the money. They repair to the motel where Dewey and Lance are holed up with the taciturn Combs ( Ed Corbin ) and his dimwit son Junior ( Adam Bartley ) who have a grudge against the Bennetts because of Mags' \"sell-out\" to the mining company. Dickie tries to call Limehouse. After one failed attempt to make contact because of caution by Limehouse's man, a connection is made after Dickie assures Limehouse that he \"knows how to talk\" on a 'phone. \"I assume you are aware of the situation up here,\" Limehouse says in reference to the police presence. Dickie is aware, which is why he needs Limehouse to personally deliver the \"package.\"||||| Devil returns to Johnny's recently reclaimed bar where Boyd hands him a small stack of bills. Devil, thinking of Quarles's proposition, wonders when Boyd plans to execute a big score. Boyd dismisses Devil, telling his flunky to be patient. Devil scowls. Then Givens enters. He inquires regarding the whereabouts of his own father and then tells the story of the night his mother finally left after years of abuse. Givens was just a boy. Mom ran to Limehouse territory, Nobles Hollow, where white women sometimes went for shelter because they knew their men wouldn't follow. Well, a drunken Arlo did follow, only to be \"felled\" by a young Limehouse when he tried to land a haymaker to the man. \"He beat him so bad that I had to drag him back to the car and drive him home myself,\" Givens concludes before revealing that he had just visited Limehouse today. Boyd wonders why such a visit occurred. Givens explains that Dickie and Dewey escaped prison. Boyd suggests that Givens take a closer look at the prison medic.||||| Later, Devil corners Johnny, asking about the low payment from Boyd. Devil reminds Johnny that he is in a wheelchair because of Boyd. \"There was a time I believed in Boyd Crowder,\" Devil says. \"But the man we have today is not that Boyd. Not by a long shot.\" Devil then tells Johnny about the Quarles deal. Givens, in the meantime, is parked outside the motel hideout after his tip from Boyd. He looks up to see Ash crossing the parking lot with a box full of coffee and take-out lunches. Ash stops dead in his tracks. The two stare at each other. Then Ash drops the food and reaches for his gun. Givens slams on the gas pedal and the car hurtles forward into Ash, knocking him down. When the guard somehow manages to stand and awkwardly start shooting, Givens throws the car into reverse, hitting him again. Givens then goes inside the motel room to find a cigarette still burning, but no escapees. Just then, a van peels out of the motel parking lot, closely followed by a car. Lance, Dickie, Dewey and the Combs, father and son, have left the scene.||||| Givens then extracts info from the seriously injured Ash. The plan is for Limehouse to bring Mags' money to her old store, where Dickie will meet him. Givens calls Rachel, who reports that she has just turned around a truck full of pig manure at the police check point and sent it back into the holler, and that she hasn't let any traffic out of Limehouse's holler. Realizing that Mags' money will not be delivered and that Dickie might just die because of that, Givens curses as he suspects that he now might have to save Dickie Bennett. Dickie, meanwhile, is forced into his mom's old store at gunpoint by the Combs father and son. The place has been trashed. Dickie begins looking behind the wall for the money and pulls out a battered cooler. He slowly lifts the lid when there is a pair of blasts. Ash's accomplices fall dead... and out steps Limehouse who took an old underground railroad trail to evade the police checkpoint at the bridge.||||| Overjoyed, Dickie opens the cooler to reveal a measly amount of cash, $46,313 to be precise. \"There was supposed to be $3 million in there!\" Dickie exclaims. Limehouse calmly explains that it was spent by Mags to buy up surrounding property, and that there are receipts for everything. Dickie, who suspects Limehouse, pushes away the money. He refuses to accept that amount. Dickie only asks for a shotgun, and Limehouse directs his associate to unload his and give it to Dickie. \"Are you good with this, Mr. Bennett?\" asks Limehouse. Dickie just laughs in disbelief. After Limehouse exits with his cohort, Givens pulls up to the store to hear shotgun blasts. He enters to find Dickie sitting inside. The escapee has been firing off random shots. \"I hereby surrender,\" Dickie says. \"To be very clear, I am the victim here,\" and Givens agrees, and wonders where Dewey might be.||||| Dewey has been taped to a chair in a hotel room by the medic. Lance then wheels Dickie past a long row of surgical tools. He spreads a tarp on the bed. Dewey screams -- and Lance again injects him. Once more, Dewey goes limp. The medic then calls someone on his cell. \"I may have a way for us to make some more money.\" Back at Johnny's bar, Devil and Johnny approach Boyd. Devil explains that this particular conversation has been a longtime coming.||||| Devil then pulls a gun and aims it at Boyd who feigns resignation and regret, then asks for a final indulgence from his wouldbe executioner, one last question. \"Whatever led you in your imagination to believe you could pull this off?\" Johnny then puts a gun on Devil, whose mouth drops open. Boyd rises, gun in hand, and shoots Devil in the chest. \"All I ever asked for was your loyalty,\" Boyd whispers to the stricken man who have pledged his loyalty, then reneged. \"Hurts, don't it,\" Boyd says. \"I know, I've been there, too.

Ash ( Bruce Campbell ) lands in Medieval England in the 13th Century, where he is immediately captured by Lord Arthur ( Marcus Gilbert ) and his men, who suspect him to be an agent for Duke Henry, with whom Arthur is at war.||||| He is enslaved along with the captured Duke Henry The Red ( Richard Grove ), his gun and chainsaw confiscated, and is taken to a castle. Ash is thrown in a pit where he regains his chainsaw from Arthur's Wise Man ( Ian Abercrombie ) in mid-air, decapitates a female Deadite and lops the hand off another, before escaping the pit. He decks Arthur using the \"your shoelace is untied\" gag. Ash demands that Henry and his men be set free (since Henry was sympathetic to him) and they ride off. He uses the shotgun to blow the end off of Arthur's sword, and to blow a large Deadite back into the pit.

As a result of the shooting, Van Buren is ordered to see Doctor Olivet and she believes that killing James was a mistake, but is also angered that after all she has done in her 12 year career she is starting to lose everything.

They find out that he used the alias of a dead gangbanger who was pretty popular. The two speak to Detective Brian Keene who had arrested the gangbanger several times and confirms that he's still popular enough that several kids might use his name as an alias. Keene points them to where those kids would hang out and they spot a kid with an arm wound named Zack Rowland and arrest him. While he confirms that he and James did try to rob Van Buren, he claims they were unarmed and tried to rob through intimidation and she went crazy and started shooting. They are unable to locate Zack's gun, but with the help of James' girlfriend Gwen, they find it and it matches Van Buren's description of the gun pulled on her, seemingly proving her story.

However, McCoy and Kincaid recall that the teacher had told them that James had needed her help to learn how to write Gwen's name and it would be printed on the bracelet, but he'd gotten the help some time before his death.||||| Realizing that James may have already gotten the bracelet which would negate his motive for committing robbery, McCoy sends Van Buren to ask James' mother about the bracelet. Mrs. Gordon refuses to help Van Buren as she killed her son, but when Van Buren reveals her immense guilt over his death and asks her to help prevent more kids from dying on the streets, the mother reveals that James did buy the bracelet, having presumably sold valuable baseball cards he collected for the money.

Loke gives Lucy her keys (once more), but not before showing her an \"I Love Lucy\" sign. Seconds later Happy rolls his tongue to say He liiiiiikes you , much to Lucy's annoyance.||||| At the guild, Gajeel , Levy and Natsu learn of Lucy's victory. Gajeel is incredulous of this, but Natsu affirms that Lucy is strong. While they bicker, Levy finally cracks Fried 's code, and is able to release them. Elsewhere, Mirajane finds a wounded Elfman on the ground. She apologizes to him, feeling that during Fairy Tail's crises she was unable to help, and is reduced to tears. Elfman tries to calm her down by telling her to smile at everyone when the battle is over, but is ineffective and Mirajane sobs, feeling guilt-ridden. Meanwhile, Cana and Juvia are looking for Laxus , when they encounter Fried. He traps them inside his Jutsu Shiki , and forces them to fight each-other, if they want to leave. Juvia sacrifices herself by attacking one of the Lacrimas in the air, releasing the Jutsu Shiki. In her last conscious words, she expresses that she just wanted people to accept her as a member of Fairy Tail, but Cana says they already have. She cries that she is her friend and an amazing Fairy Tail Mage, which makes Juvia happy, as she faints, and makes Cana furious and attacks Fried.||||| Meanwhile, Natsu and Gajeel have split up and are looking for Laxus. Gajeel talks through a Shikigami to Master Ivan Dreyar , and he responds that for the time being his mission is to gain the Fairy Tail members' trust, and to not be discovered. He orders him to act as a full fledged Fairy Tail member, and adds that Fairy Tail's punishment will soon come. Mirajane and Elfman unknowingly enter Cana's and Fried's battlefield, and watch as Cana gets defeated. Elfman intervenes, but Fried, deeming him defeated and out of the game, attacks him with Dark Ecriture , torturing him . Mirajane watches, feeling useless, and begs Fried to stop.

This sends Mirajane into a state of shock, in which she remembers the final moments of Lisanna 's life and the pain she went through, imagining the death of her only living sibling.||||| Mirajane's Magic Power awakens in a blast of light and she uses Satan Soul . She jumps at Fried, who is forced to use his Dark Ecriture: Wings to try and evade her, but to no end. Mirajane releases her wings too, and follows him, and attacks with many Darkness Magic Spells. Fried, in response, performs a spell he claims to be forbidden: Dark Ecriture: Darkness . This turns Fried into a Demon too, but Mirajane still has the upper hand. While fighting, she uses various Elemental Magics, before finally managing to incapacitate Fried. When she approaches to deliver the final blow, Lisanna's face and last smile flash through her mind, and Mirajane deactivates Satan Soul. She loses the will to fight, and reminds Fried of their relationship as nakama and that they are from the same Guild, meaning that they are family. Fried, realizing that he dearly treasured the bonds his Guild has given him, begins to cry, admitting that he never wanted to take part in Laxus' plan.

Loke gives Lucy her keys (once more), but not before showing her an \"I Love Lucy\" sign. Seconds later Happy rolls his tongue to say He liiiiiikes you , much to Lucy's annoyance.||||| At the guild, Gajeel , Levy and Natsu learn of Lucy's victory. Gajeel is incredulous of this, but Natsu affirms that Lucy is strong. While they bicker, Levy finally cracks Fried 's code, and is able to release them. Elsewhere, Mirajane finds a wounded Elfman on the ground. She apologizes to him, feeling that during Fairy Tail's crises she was unable to help, and is reduced to tears. Elfman tries to calm her down by telling her to smile at everyone when the battle is over, but is ineffective and Mirajane sobs, feeling guilt-ridden. Meanwhile, Cana and Juvia are looking for Laxus , when they encounter Fried. He traps them inside his Jutsu Shiki , and forces them to fight each-other, if they want to leave. Juvia sacrifices herself by attacking one of the Lacrimas in the air, releasing the Jutsu Shiki. In her last conscious words, she expresses that she just wanted people to accept her as a member of Fairy Tail, but Cana says they already have. She cries that she is her friend and an amazing Fairy Tail Mage, which makes Juvia happy, as she faints, and makes Cana furious and attacks Fried.||||| Meanwhile, Natsu and Gajeel have split up and are looking for Laxus. Gajeel talks through a Shikigami to Master Ivan Dreyar , and he responds that for the time being his mission is to gain the Fairy Tail members' trust, and to not be discovered. He orders him to act as a full fledged Fairy Tail member, and adds that Fairy Tail's punishment will soon come. Mirajane and Elfman unknowingly enter Cana's and Fried's battlefield, and watch as Cana gets defeated. Elfman intervenes, but Fried, deeming him defeated and out of the game, attacks him with Dark Ecriture , torturing him . Mirajane watches, feeling useless, and begs Fried to stop. He doesn't and prepares to use his final spell, Dark Ecriture: Death . This sends Mirajane into a state of shock, in which she remembers the final moments of Lisanna 's life and the pain she went through, imagining the death of her only living sibling.||||| Mirajane's Magic Power awakens in a blast of light and she uses Satan Soul . She jumps at Fried, who is forced to use his Dark Ecriture: Wings to try and evade her, but to no end. Mirajane releases her wings too, and follows him, and attacks with many Darkness Magic Spells. Fried, in response, performs a spell he claims to be forbidden: Dark Ecriture: Darkness . This turns Fried into a Demon too, but Mirajane still has the upper hand. While fighting, she uses various Elemental Magics, before finally managing to incapacitate Fried. When she approaches to deliver the final blow, Lisanna's face and last smile flash through her mind, and Mirajane deactivates Satan Soul. She loses the will to fight, and reminds Fried of their relationship as nakama and that they are from the same Guild, meaning that they are family. Fried, realizing that he dearly treasured the bonds his Guild has given him, begins to cry, admitting that he never wanted to take part in Laxus' plan. With this, the battle of Fairy Tail is near its conclusion. Laxus is the only one left, alongside Natsu, Gajeel, Erza and Mystogan .", "row": 90, "response": "Here is the list of main concepts mentioned in the story using the 5 W's, 1 H retell strategy:\n\n**Who:**\n\n* Loke and Lucy (main characters)\n* Bickslow (antagonist)\n* Happy (supporting character)\n* Gajeel, Levy, Natsu, Mirajane, Elfman, Cana, Juvia, Laxus, Erza, Mystogan, Fried, Master Ivan Dreyar, Lisanna (other characters)\n\n**What:**\n\n* Loke and Lucy fight against Bickslow\n* Lucy attacks Bickslow with her whip\n* Bickslow uses Figure Eyes to blind Loke and Lucy\n* Loke uses Lion Brilliance to illuminate the area and defeat Bickslow\n* Lucy traps Bickslow with her whip\n* Loke regains his Magic Power with Lucy as his Master\n* Levy cracks Fried's code and releases the trapped members\n* Mirajane finds a wounded Elfman and apologizes for not being able to help\n* Cana and Juvia are trapped by Fried and forced to fight each other\n* Juvia sacrifices herself to release the Jutsu Shiki\n* Cana attacks Fried in anger\n* Gajeel talks to Master Ivan Dreyar through a Shikigami\n* Mirajane's Magic Power awakens and she uses Satan Soul to defeat Fried\n\n**When:**\n\n* The story takes place during the Fairy Tail Guild's crisis\n\n**Where:**\n\n* The story takes place in the Fairy Tail Guild and its surroundings\n\n**Why:**\n\n* Loke and Lucy fight against Bickslow to defeat him and protect the Guild\n* Lucy trusts Loke and asks him to find a solution to defeat Bickslow\n* Loke regains his Magic Power with Lucy as his Master because Love makes Spirits stronger\n* Mirajane apologizes to Elfman because she feels guilty for not being able to help during the crisis\n* Juvia sacrifices herself because she wants to be accepted as a member of Fairy Tail\n* Cana attacks Fried because she is angry and wants to protect Juvia\n* Mirajane uses Satan Soul to defeat Fried because she wants to protect her friends and family\n\n**How:**\n\n* Loke uses Lion Brilliance to illuminate the area and defeat Bickslow\n* Lucy uses her whip to attack and trap Bickslow\n* Loke uses Regulus Impact to defeat Bickslow\n* Levy uses her intelligence to crack Fried's code and release the trapped members\n* Mirajane uses Satan Soul and various Elemental Magics to defeat Fried", "decomposed_mcs": ["Here is the list of main concepts in plain text format.", "Loke and Lucy are main characters.", "Bickslow is an antagonist.", "Happy supporting character", "Original input returned as it is not a complete sentence.", "Loke fights against Bickslow.", "Lucy fights against Bickslow.", "Lucy attacks Bickslow with her whip", "Bickslow uses Figure Eyes.", "Bickslow uses Figure Eyes to blind Loke.", "Bickslow uses Figure Eyes to blind Lucy.", "Loke uses Lion Brilliance to illuminate the area.", "Loke uses Lion Brilliance to defeat Bickslow.", "Lucy traps Bickslow with her whip", "Loke regains his Magic Power.", "Lucy is Loke's Master.", "Levy cracks Fried's code.", "Levy releases the trapped members.", "Mirajane finds a wounded Elfman.", "Mirajane apologizes for not being able to help.", "Cana and Juvia are trapped by Fried.", "Cana and Juvia are forced to fight each other.", "Juvia sacrifices herself.", "Juvia sacrifices herself to release the Jutsu Shiki.", "Cana attacks Fried in anger", "Gajeel talks to Master Ivan Dreyar through a Shikigami.", "Mirajane's Magic Power awakens.", "Mirajane uses Satan Soul to defeat Fried.", "The story takes place during the Fairy Tail Guild's crisis", "The story takes place in the Fairy Tail Guild.", "The story takes place in the surroundings.", "Loke and Lucy fight against Bickslow.", "Loke and Lucy fight to defeat him.", "Loke and Lucy fight to protect the Guild.", "Lucy trusts Loke.", "Lucy asks Loke to find a solution to defeat Bickslow.", "Loke regains his Magic Power.", "Loke regains his Magic Power with Lucy as his Master.", "Love makes Spirits stronger.", "Mirajane apologizes to Elfman.", "Mirajane feels guilty.", "Mirajane feels guilty for not being able to help during the crisis.", "Juvia sacrifices herself.", "Juvia wants to be accepted as a member of Fairy Tail.", "Cana attacks Fried.", "Cana is angry.", "Cana wants to protect Juvia.", "Mirajane uses Satan Soul to defeat Fried.", "Mirajane wants to protect her friends and family.", "Loke uses Lion Brilliance to illuminate the area.", "Loke uses Lion Brilliance to defeat Bickslow.", "Lucy uses her whip to attack Bickslow.", "Lucy uses her whip to trap Bickslow.", "Loke uses Regulus Impact.", "Loke uses Regulus Impact to defeat Bickslow.", "Levy uses her intelligence to crack Fried's code.", "Levy releases the trapped members.", "Mirajane uses Satan Soul to defeat Fried.", "Mirajane uses various Elemental Magics to defeat Fried."]}

When we last left Music City, Scarlett was preparing to leave, Avery broke up with Juliette because she slept with the odious Jeff Fordham, Luke asked Rayna to marry him onstage and then Deacon asked Rayna to marry him later, Maddie was conflicted about all of it, Will came out to Layla not knowing it was caught on camera, and everybody was singing. (Tonight several of the musical performances are live.) First up is Rayna-Deacon-Luke.||||| Rayna is confused about what to do, and after a romp with Luke in the hay, talks to Tandy about it the next morning. Tandy can't believe that she would even consider getting back together with Deacon but knows Rayna has to make her own choice. In order to assist in this choice Rayna feels like she has to tell Luke what happened with Deacon. He is understandably upset but also gets where Deacon is coming from, not wanting to lose Rayna again, but he says if it's up to him Deacon will lose indeed. Rayna reassures him that she loves him but confesses with all of their history and with Maddie she is confused about Deacon. He says he knows she needs to think about it and if she doesn't want to attend a charity event he has that evening she doesn't have to.||||| She goes home and pulls out her old albums that feature Deacon and plays them and reminisces, both about good times singing onstage and not so good ones when he was drunk and awful and including one time when Luke subbed for Deacon at one of her shows when Deacon was a no-show. Meanwhile, Deacon is preparing for a show at the Bluebird that will be broadcast live on NPR (hence the live conceit) and when he's asked by the interviewer if he and Rayna will still collaborate, Deacon says he thinks things will work out like they're supposed to. Rayna goes to Deacon and tells him that she can't take another chance on him and that Luke offers a clean slate and stability. Deacon counters that he is a safe choice and that they will always love each other and that they have Maddie. Rayna says they will raise her together and she will always love him but things have to stay the way they are.

Deacon lobs the question back at him. Because of this exchange Deacon is now confident that Rayna will be coming. When Luke goes to his charity event alone he assumes the same. They are both surprised when she is a no-show at the Bluebird but catches up on the red carpet with Luke, waving her wedding ring and declaring her love at the same moment Deacon is onstage singing about the many times he broke her heart.||||| In the audience grooving along is Maddie, who was brought their by Teddy as a conciliatory gesture to prove that he doesn't hate Deacon or music. Teddy explains that without Deacon he wouldn't have Maddie. She appreciates her father's gesture. Also participating in the live Bluebird session is Will.

He doesn't know but says the camera crew is there so they have to go on with the show. Later, when he dedicates his song at the Bluebird to her it is too much and Layla runs off. On the tour bus outside they agree to split. When they try to tell the TV producer they want off the show, she shows them the footage of Will coming out and says the network signed on for a show about up and coming country singing newlyweds not a gay cowboy and his naive wife. They realize they are stuck.||||| Also ending up stuck are Scarlett, Gunnar, and Avery. A drunken Avery, upset by his betrayal by Juliette decides to hitch a ride back to Mississippi with Scarlett.

After Avery and Gunnar begin to fight about Avery's woes, he doesn't want Scarlett to know what happened, Scarlett pulls over and the car dies.||||| Avery continues to drink and Gunnar continues to try and convince Scarlett to come back to Nashville. Avery finally comes clean to Scarlett about Juliette and Jeff. He also confesses that he never thought he was good enough for her and a better man would come along. They get a tow to a service station where the mechanic recognizes Scarlett from video footage of her meltdown. Avery nearly gets his ass handed to him in a bar fight, but Gunnar and Scarlett managed to save him and take off.

For the rest of the day, SpongeBob fights every single urge to chuckle. First, he sees Patrick trip over a banana peel several times and runs away. Next, he sees that whoopee cushions are all over the town. Last, he sees a pie truck in an accident and some of the pie land on some fish. In a drastic measure, he buries himself never to be interrupted by a joke during the night. The next morning, SpongeBob discovers that he has completely lost the ability to laugh. He tells Patrick that he has lost his laugh, but when Patrick looks inside SpongeBob and lights a match, he runs around in circles.||||| Later, Sponge Bob goes to the Krusty Krab to tell Mr. Krabs that he has lost his laugh. Mr. Krabs says that money always makes him laugh, but SpongeBob doesn't feel a tickle. Next, SpongeBob consults Sandy. Sandy gives SpongeBob books about laughter.

Sam finds a corpse covered with a sheet, a corpse with no ID, and the walls are covered in blood. The brothers find a laptop computer with a note on it saying \"Play me.\" The Winchesters play it and a video starts up with the words \"This should never have ended this way\" come up. A student, Brian Wilcox, is filming footage at a diner... Brian is at the diner with his friend and roommate Mike Walker, debating about what Brian should make a movie about. As Mike goofs off with his friend's camera, they spot several girls at a booth nearby and Mike good-naturedly suggests they might take pity on Brian. One of the girls, Kate, comes over and asks if they're filming her. She discusses camera technology with Brian but is clearly attracted to Mike.||||| Later, Brian is at the house. Kate and Mike are in the next room making love. Once they're done, Kate comes out, awkwardly says hi to Brian, and goes to the kitchen. Brian, Mike, and Kate go back to the diner and Brian and Kate talk cameras. Mike doesn't know anything about cameras but Kate assures Brian that she's teaching her boyfriend about them. The friends film each other talking about what they plan to do in five years. Kate wants to be an environmentalist, a lawyer, or both.||||| Brian wants to work in Hollywood, and Mike plans to set sail to the middle of the ocean and take things easy. Brian is filming a literature lecture by Professor Ludensky on Lord of the Flies. Kate comes in and confirms that Brian is taping for Mike, who has dozed off again. As they leave, another student, Scott Parker bumps into Brian, knocking his camera to the ground. He runs off and the three friends follow. The police are securing a nearby crime scene where a student, Jacob Carter, was brutally murdered. Sam and Dean, posing as FBI agents, are on the scene. The detective in charge tells them that a neighbor woman reported growling noises and Jacob screams.||||| Back at their house, the three friends discuss what they saw and figure that it's a good thing that the FBI is checking out the murder. Mike puts on the song that was playing at the diner when he first met Kate as a gift to her. Brian asks him to come with him to test some new cameras and Mike agrees. Before he goes, he privately tells Kate that he's going because Brian doesn't have any other friends. Brian and Mike film some footage of the stadium and spot Sam and Dean nearby. They listen in as Sam figures that it's a normal murder but Dean believes that they need to dig deeper. As night falls, Brian and Mike spot Scott and his girlfriend making out behind the bleachers. She slaps Scott and walks away, and Scott spots Mike and Brian and chases after them. The friends split up and Mike records himself as he wanders in the woods. Something attacks him, dragging him off-camera. When Brian finds Mike a little later, he realizes that something has bitten his friend. However, by the time he gets Mike home, the bite mark has vanished.||||| The next day, Mike gets a checkup but the doctor can't find anything wrong with him. As he opens a door, Mike inadvertently rips it off its hinges and they realize that he is now super strong. He lifts Kate one-handed into the air and wonders if he's become a superhero. Brian decides to place cameras throughout the house. When Kate notices, Brian explains that he wants to record Mike's origin story and make a film out of it.||||| As Mike eats, Brian says that he wants to go out and get bitten so that they can both be superheroes. Mike refuses, saying that his friend doesn't want what he has. Brian begs him to do it but Mike refuses. Later, Mike and Kate are using a bong when Sam and Dean arrive at the door. As they hide, Brian answers the door and the brothers ask him if they know anything about Jacob's murder, or rumors of someone being bitten. Brian denies everything and they leave, and Kate and Mike record the brothers out on the porch as they talk about dealing with another Mayan god. They play the tape back for Brian and they wonder if Mike has become a Mayan deity.||||| That night, Kate dozes off and Mike goes to the bathroom mirror and admires himself. However, as he films himself he realizes that he is growing fangs and claws. He smashes the mirror and then goes to look at the sleeping Kate for a minute. After stroking her cheek, he goes down to the kitchen and eats in the refrigerator, but is still hungry. Scott and his friends are out patrolling the neighborhood, looking for the killer animal.||||| Scott films himself and spots Mike, who says that he isn't in the mood for Scott's antics. Mike runs off into the woods and Scott chases after him, calling him a coward and saying that he'll go after Kate if Mike won't turn around and fight him. As Scott tries to spot him, Mike transforms and attacks him. The next morning, Brian wonders if Kate is scared of Michael but she says that his being a superhero is kind of hot. Mike comes in, covered in blood, and his friends stare at him in horror. He takes a shower to wash off the blood and then tells them that he killed Scott. They go over the footage that Mike filmed in the bathroom and see his claws, and Kate tells Brian to turn off the camera.||||| Brian goes to the park where Scott was killed and watches while Sam and Dean talk to the local detective. He tells the brothers that the same thing killed Scott as Jacob and that it left Scott's partially-eaten heart in the street. Michael goes back and tells his friends what happened, but Mike doesn't remember eating the heart. Kate insists that it was self-defense but Brian points out how unlikely that is and snaps at Mike. Mike shoves him across the room with one hand and then creaks down. When he says that he doesn't know who he is anymore, Kate says that he's hers. Brian insists that they have to call the police and that Mike is risking himself and them.||||| Kate angrily tells him that he doesn't understand because he's never been in love and sets out to get some answers about Mike's condition. Mike and Kate follow Sam and Dean to the morgue and listen as Sam tells Dean that ten years ago there was a similar murder. However, it didn't take place during the full moon. Once they leave, Kate wants to follow but Mike doesn't see the point. Brian arrives, having tracked his friends' cell phone GPSs. They wonder if he can hack anything and he assures them that he can. They follow the Winchesters to a diner and Brian hacks the security camera. Mike goes in with a hidden camera and sits at the table next to the brothers. The three friends watch and listen as Sam finds an entry about how close descendants of the Pureblood can control their change and subsist on animal hearts. The brothers figure that one of the purer werewolves came to town, killed its victim, and then decided to stay.||||| The three friends return to their house and Mike starts to panic, figuring the 'FBI' is after him. Kate doesn't believe that the Winchesters are FBI and that they'll start by looking for the pureblood. Mike doesn't believe it and goes to his bedroom and Kate goes after him. They argue while Brian goes over the footage of the original attack on Mike. He spots something on the ground and calls to Kate, but she slams the door shut. Brian has no choice but to go out on his own and examine the attack site. He finds a pin on the ground and realizes that it's the same one that Ludensky was wearing at his last lecture.||||| Brian goes to Ludensky's office and tells him that he knows what the professor really is. Later, Brian comes home and finds Kate packing. As Mike comes out, Brian says that he took care of things and they ask what he did. He shows them footage of his confronting Ludensky and asking the professor to bite him as well. He warns the professor that he hid cameras in his office in advance and is transmitting the video to his laptop at home. Ludensky denies being a werewolf until Brian threatens him with a silver blade. Then he breaks down and explains that after the one murder ten years ago, he only ate animal hearts. However, he saw Jacob, weak and alone, and couldn't resist. Ludensky figured that hunters would come eventually so he needed a patsy. He chose Mike since he's always sleeping in and the professor figured that no one would miss him. Brian says that he wants to become a werewolf and forces the professor to bite his arm.||||| As the footage ends, Brian starts to transform and shows him footage of the office after he left. Sam and Dean come in and attack Ludensky, eventually killing him. With his dying breath, the professor thanks them. The brothers find the camera and take it down, cutting the transmission, and Brian figures that they're safe. He tells Kate that he protected her when Mike couldn't, but Mike figures the Winchesters will trace the feed back to Brian. Brian, angry and disgusted, tells Mike that he's tired of living in his shadow and that he finally has what he wants. Mike tries to persuade his friend that he doesn't want the horror inside of him, the horror that he experienced when he went out of control and killed Scott. Brian tells Kate that she needs him and grabs her, and Mike transforms and attacks him. The two students struggle and Brian stabs Mike with the silver dagger, killing him. Kate goes to her lover, who says with his dying breath that he loves her.||||| Kate tries to stab Brian, who easily grabs her and says that she'll understand... and then bites her. She locks herself in the bathroom and films herself using a camera, and then goes berserk. Kate finally gets control of herself and calls to Brian, saying that she understands. She goes outside and tells Brian that she understands...and then rips his throat out. Afterward, she covers Mike's corpse with a sheet and then sits down at the computer to record her message to the Winchesters.||||| She tells that she and her friends weren't monsters and didn't want what happened to them. Kate then says that she's leaving and that she will eat animal hearts and never hurt anyone, and promises that they won't hear about her. Before signing off, Kate tells the Winchesters to give her a chance. Sam and Dean look at the computer and wonder what to do next. Sam hesitantly suggests that they let her leave. Much to his surprise, Dean agrees, saying that they should give Kate a chance. They can always kill her if she fails to keep her promise. They collect all of the evidence that werewolves were there and leave.

Sam finds a corpse covered with a sheet, a corpse with no ID, and the walls are covered in blood. The brothers find a laptop computer with a note on it saying \"Play me.\" The Winchesters play it and a video starts up with the words \"This should never have ended this way\" come up. A student, Brian Wilcox, is filming footage at a diner... Brian is at the diner with his friend and roommate Mike Walker, debating about what Brian should make a movie about. As Mike goofs off with his friend's camera, they spot several girls at a booth nearby and Mike good-naturedly suggests they might take pity on Brian. One of the girls, Kate, comes over and asks if they're filming her. She discusses camera technology with Brian but is clearly attracted to Mike.||||| Later, Brian is at the house. Kate and Mike are in the next room making love. Once they're done, Kate comes out, awkwardly says hi to Brian, and goes to the kitchen. Brian, Mike, and Kate go back to the diner and Brian and Kate talk cameras. Mike doesn't know anything about cameras but Kate assures Brian that she's teaching her boyfriend about them. The friends film each other talking about what they plan to do in five years. Kate wants to be an environmentalist, a lawyer, or both.||||| Brian wants to work in Hollywood, and Mike plans to set sail to the middle of the ocean and take things easy. Brian is filming a literature lecture by Professor Ludensky on Lord of the Flies. Kate comes in and confirms that Brian is taping for Mike, who has dozed off again. As they leave, another student, Scott Parker bumps into Brian, knocking his camera to the ground. He runs off and the three friends follow. The police are securing a nearby crime scene where a student, Jacob Carter, was brutally murdered. Sam and Dean, posing as FBI agents, are on the scene. The detective in charge tells them that a neighbor woman reported growling noises and Jacob screams.||||| Back at their house, the three friends discuss what they saw and figure that it's a good thing that the FBI is checking out the murder. Mike puts on the song that was playing at the diner when he first met Kate as a gift to her. Brian asks him to come with him to test some new cameras and Mike agrees. Before he goes, he privately tells Kate that he's going because Brian doesn't have any other friends. Brian and Mike film some footage of the stadium and spot Sam and Dean nearby.

Hanna and her mother return home talking about where Wilden might be. Ashley wants to call the police but Hanna talks her out of it. She makes Hanna promise not to tell her friends until they figure out their next step. They hear the siren and see the flashing lights of a police car as it drives past. The other three girls continue to talk about Toby. Emily doesn't believe Toby would ever do anything like this. She thinks there must be something happening and thinks Mona must have something over him.||||| Spencer points out that Mona is out of town with the Decathlon team, meaning she couldn't have locked her in the steam room. E. Lamb\n\nEmily calls Toby and leaves a message saying she wants to talk. She takes a key out of a drawer. Aria arrives at Ezra's apartment and finds his son Malcolm is visiting. He and Maggie are in town for \"a few days\" and tells Aria that Maggie is looking for work in Rosewood . Ezra invites her to stay and spend some time with him. Aria says she doesn't think Maggie would be to happy with that, but Ezra assures her that Maggie knows exactly what Aria means to him. Emily finds Hanna intently watching the news instead of helping her search for info on Toby. Emily isn't convinced Toby could be dangerous. They find a parking pass for Radley Sanitarium with \" E. Lamb \" on it in one of Toby's books. Hanna thinks Emily should talk to Toby's parents.||||| \"They didn't make it through the night.\" Aria seems to be getting along well with Malcolm. Maggie comes home and is left alone with Aria. She tells Maggie she wasn't the person who told Ezra he had a child. Maggie says that she she was really happy he knew. She has a lead on a job the same time Ezra will be busy, so Aria suggests that she watch Malcolm. Flowers with a banner reading \"With Deepest Sympathy\" are delivered to Spencer. Attached is a note from \"A\": \"Someone close to you will pay for your loose lips.\" The girls talk in the coffee shop and Emily tells Spencer she's looking for Toby. Mona shows up to get coffee and Spencer brings up the flower arrangement and warns her to leave her friends alone. Mona leaves after telling Spencer not to leave the orchids (the flowers in the arrangement) in direct sunlight. She did once; they didn't make it through the night. She then looks pointedly at Emily.||||| Spencer stares at the flowers\n\nElla tells Aria that Ezra was asking about a job for his 'friend' Maggie, and asks if Aria knows her. Aria says she's never met her. Emily goes to Toby's house but it seems no one is home. She meets and talks to a co-worker of Toby's. He said Toby told him he had an emergency and asked him to finish the job he was working on. Spencer takes a close look at her flowers and finds that the letters \"E\" and \"M\" in \"DEEPEST SYMPATHIES\" have been highlighted. Ashley thinks she sees Wilden on the other side of the road. While looking at him, she is almost hit by a car. When she looks back Wilden is gone.||||| Spencer goes to see Emily and tells her that the letters being highlighted on the arrangement means \"A\" is coming after her next (EMily). Spencer doesn't want her to go out. Emily won't do that but she does promise to stop looking for Toby. Aria and Hanna wonder if there were signs they missed with Toby. Hanna looks out the window and hears sirens. Aria asks if she's ok, but Hanna brushes it off and says she has to go and meet her mom. Emily asks Pam about looking into Toby's disappearance. Pam admits she doesn't trust Toby. When Pam steps away from her desk, Emily uses her computer. While Aria has her back turned leaving a voicemail and going to the fridge, Malcolm falls while jumping on the bed. He has a fairly significant cut on his chin. Emily searches the police database for \"E. Lamb.\" One result is found, but before the picture can finish loading Pam returns briefly. Emily resumes her search just as she gets a text from Toby: \"Stop looking. I'll meet you.\"||||| Mona gets a call from someone at the coffee shop, telling them \"I'm on my way.\" She has a large amount of cash in a clutch bag. Spencer is listening from behind and follows her out the door. Aria brings Malcolm to the hospital. Aria apologizes, but Ezra says it's fine. However, he keeps asking what happened and why she wasn't watching him the whole time so he can tell Maggie. Spencer follows Mona to a wooded location. She gets out of the car and follows her on foot. Hanna gets home and calls Ashley, wondering where she is. She finds Wilden's car in their garage. She watches the video of the incident from the dashboard camera. Emily arrives at the place Toby told her to meet him but he is not there. Maggie arrives at the hospital, Aria is asked to leave by the nurse as she is not family.||||| Toby is dead? Spencer finds a body on the ground. It has a familiar tattoo on the stomach and she begins to cry, believing it to be Toby. She starts to pull off the helmet but Mona says, \"He's dead.\" Spencer gets up and begins to chase her but she doesn't catch up, eventually falling to her knees and crying. Aria finally comes clean to Ella about Malcolm and Maggie. Aria wonders how much things will change between her and Ezra. Ella tells her it's okay if Aria doesn't want to take this dramatic step, and that not all relationships are meant to last forever. It's two hours past Emily's meet time with Toby and nobody is there. She sees a blonde in a red coat duck into a door. Emily walks in and it turns out to be Toby's co-worker's workshop. He tries to tell her he didn't see the blonde and still hasn't seen Toby, then calls her \"Emily\" even though she never told him her name.||||| Aria and Hanna pushed the car\n\nHanna tells Aria about the car being in her garage. They wonder if perhaps Wilden is dead and if \"A\" has his body. Aria thinks Hanna should tell Ashley, but she doesn't think her mother can handle it. Emily returns to her car to find the window has been smashed. There is an envelope with her name on it on her seat. There is a note inside that reads \"Toby is no more,\" along with a funeral program for Toby. Hanna and Aria push Wilden's car into a lake. The car eventually sinks to the bottom.||||| Hanna returns home and Ashley tells her about thinking that she saw Wilden. She drove by the accident and found the car gone. Ashley assumes that since they haven't heard from Wilden she didn't actually hit him as hard as she thought. Spencer in Radley\n\nAria calls Ezra to check on Malcolm. He's doing fine, but Ezra wants her to come over. Aria makes up an excuse as to why she can't come. The police are bringing in Spencer who was found by a hiker, who can't tell them her name and appears to be completely catatonic. The other three girls wonder what the message from \"A\" about Toby could mean. We see Spencer in a bed at Radley.

Emily searches the police database for \"E. Lamb.\" One result is found, but before the picture can finish loading Pam returns briefly. Emily resumes her search just as she gets a text from Toby: \"Stop looking. I'll meet you.\"||||| Mona gets a call from someone at the coffee shop, telling them \"I'm on my way.\" She has a large amount of cash in a clutch bag. Spencer is listening from behind and follows her out the door. Aria brings Malcolm to the hospital. Aria apologizes, but Ezra says it's fine. However, he keeps asking what happened and why she wasn't watching him the whole time so he can tell Maggie. Spencer follows Mona to a wooded location. She gets out of the car and follows her on foot. Hanna gets home and calls Ashley, wondering where she is. She finds Wilden's car in their garage. She watches the video of the incident from the dashboard camera. Emily arrives at the place Toby told her to meet him but he is not there. Maggie arrives at the hospital, Aria is asked to leave by the nurse as she is not family.||||| Toby is dead? Spencer finds a body on the ground. It has a familiar tattoo on the stomach and she begins to cry, believing it to be Toby. She starts to pull off the helmet but Mona says, \"He's dead.\" Spencer gets up and begins to chase her but she doesn't catch up, eventually falling to her knees and crying. Aria finally comes clean to Ella about Malcolm and Maggie. Aria wonders how much things will change between her and Ezra. Ella tells her it's okay if Aria doesn't want to take this dramatic step, and that not all relationships are meant to last forever. It's two hours past Emily's meet time with Toby and nobody is there. She sees a blonde in a red coat duck into a door. Emily walks in and it turns out to be Toby's co-worker's workshop. He tries to tell her he didn't see the blonde and still hasn't seen Toby, then calls her \"Emily\" even though she never told him her name.||||| Aria and Hanna pushed the car\n\nHanna tells Aria about the car being in her garage. They wonder if perhaps Wilden is dead and if \"A\" has his body. Aria thinks Hanna should tell Ashley, but she doesn't think her mother can handle it. Emily returns to her car to find the window has been smashed. There is an envelope with her name on it on her seat. There is a note inside that reads \"Toby is no more,\" along with a funeral program for Toby. Hanna and Aria push Wilden's car into a lake. The car eventually sinks to the bottom.||||| Hanna returns home and Ashley tells her about thinking that she saw Wilden. She drove by the accident and found the car gone. Ashley assumes that since they haven't heard from Wilden she didn't actually hit him as hard as she thought. Spencer in Radley\n\nAria calls Ezra to check on Malcolm. He's doing fine, but Ezra wants her to come over. Aria makes up an excuse as to why she can't come. The police are bringing in Spencer who was found by a hiker, who can't tell them her name and appears to be completely catatonic. The other three girls wonder what the message from \"A\" about Toby could mean. We see Spencer in a bed at Radley.
