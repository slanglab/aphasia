{"Prompt": "Suppose you are a story-reteller, generate a list of main concepts to help me understand the story.\n\nStory: Victim: Four victims (deceased) On the case: Gil Grissom, Nick Stokes, Sara Sidle\n\nGrissom, Nick and Sara arrive on the scene of a mass murder, four Buddhist monks from Thailand lay dead in their temple. Another monk, Ananda, who claims to have been at a bank depositing money they'd gathered to build a school during the murders, called for help. Each victim was shot between the eyes at close range, one at a time. A gang sign belonging to a gang known as \"The Snakebacks\" is carved into the wall. Grissom concludes that they sat still because they were praying for whoever shot them. In a temple garden, Grissom finds a potential murder weapon, a rifle.||||| When the room is processed, Sara extracts a recent boot print from the carpet floor, even though shoes are not supposed to be worn inside a Buddhist temple. She also finds a trace amount of a blue material on a statue and a used chewing gum on another. When Ananda's office is searched, the CSIs find a porn magazine, which is strange since Buddhism discourages seeking pleasure. The lab confirms that the rifle is the murder weapon. It also has Ananda's prints on it. At the autopsy, Doc Robbins explains that the area where all victims were shot corresponds to the Sixth Chakra. In Buddhism, the Chakras are the body's seven energy centers. The Sixth Chakra, also known as \"the Third Eye\", is the hub of higher consciousness. When Ananda is brought in for questioning, he explains that he found the rifle in his office and carried it outdoors because his faith doesn't allow weapons in the temple. The porn magazine was left in the temple by a visitor and Ananda kept it in case that person came back for it.||||| A further fingerprint analysis confirms that Ananda never touched the trigger of the gun; the locations of the prints are consistent with his story that he only carried the gun. Nick suspects that the gang sign is a false lead; after a number of murders, the LVPD came down hard on the Snakebacks and brought the whole gang down. Through David in autopsy, Grissom contacts a local Air Force base. Since 9/11, they keep satellite surveillance of bases and other key buildings. Since the temple is close to a base, it is within the range of a satellite. A photo shows a car with vanity plates \"PROUDUS\" outside the temple close to the time of the murders. The car is registered to Peter Hutchins Sr., a local diner owner who was unhappy with the monks having a temple so close to his establishment, blaming them for the drop in local stores' business. Inside the car, Sara finds a set of prayer beads that doesn't belong to Hutchins Sr.||||| At the lab, the CSIs learn that Peter Hutchins Sr. has an alibi for the murders. Greg examines the blue substance found on a statue and determines that it is paintball paint. Grissom, Nick and Sara visit a nearby paintball field, where Hutchins' son, Pete Hutchins Jr., is playing. Sara compares a shoe print left by his boot to the boot print found on the scene and sees that it is similar. Pete is brought in for questioning, accompanied by his father, and denies having been to the temple.||||| When pressured with the boot print, Pete claims to have brought some friends in to look into the rumors that there was money and drugs inside. When Grissom remarks that the lab's dust lifter only works on recent prints, Pete confesses that a friend took a gold statue from the temple when they were there. He went there to return it and found the monks as he was taking off his boots. He didn't call the police because he was afraid that he would become a suspect. When Grissom asks how he knew he was supposed to remove his boots when entering the temple, Pete admits, to his father's shame, to being interested in Buddhism and considering the monks his friends.||||| With Pete cleared, Greg examines the chewing gum found on a statue and finds trace amounts of curry and saffron on it. Grissom consults with Ananda and presents the lab's findings to him. The spices found on the gum suggest that someone ate them and then chewed the gum. Ananda shows Grissom the temple's kitchen, the cooking of which uses curry and saffron. O'Riley confronts the two with some new evidence: even though the monks raised ca. $13 000 for their charity project, Ananda only deposited $12 000 when he was at the bank. The account was opened the same day as the murders were committed.||||| Before that, Ananda kept the money in a box in his office. Grissom examines the box and finds curry powder inside. Suspicion falls on the temple's part-time cook, David Suddahara, whom Ananda caught stealing from the charity fund, which is why Ananda opened a bank account to keep the money safe.

Catherine brings up Dwight Kelso, who was convicted of killing her best friend, Stephanie Watson, during her dancer days. Kelso, who recently died of cancer in prison, made a television appearance on his deathbed. He confessed to killing a man in Reno, but maintains that he didn't kill Stephanie. Even though Kelso had been seen harassing her at the bar and had a knife cut on his hand when he was arrested a block away from the murder site, Catherine still feels insecure about the case. Together with Warrick, she signs out the case evidence, which is due to be destroyed, and re-examines it in the lab. When she and Greg examine the murder weapon, a bloody knife, they notice a small spot of blood that wasn't examined at the time of the murder. Catherine figures that it was ignored because the lab couldn't get a DNA sample from such a small amount.||||| When the test results come back, they show that the small spot is not from Kelso or Stephanie, but a third contributor, a male. Ecklie is initially a bit angry that the evidence was signed out without his knowledge, but gets onboard when he learns of the new evidence. In the display room, Warrick goes over the crime scene photos and notices that a glove that belonged to Kelso and was found on the scene isn't in a single crime scene photo or sketch. Catherine becomes suspicious when she learns that it was logged by Jimmy - two days after the murder. Catherine takes Jimmy to the crime scene to go over the crime again. He shows her the dumpster in which the glove was found, claiming the arresting officer didn't see the glove because it was dark and he was busy grabbing Kelso. Jimmy is offended when Catherine asks whether he tampered with the evidence.||||| Back at the lab, Warrick runs more tests on the knife and finds remains of saliva in the blood on both the glove and the knife - Kelso's saliva. Catherine suspects that the blood came from a mouth injury and was then transferred from the glove onto the knife. She confronts Jimmy, who admits that he \"helped the evidence along\". When Kelso was arrested, the DA didn't feel like there was enough non-circumstantial evidence to charge him with the murder and he was released. Jimmy attacked Kelso outside, beating him while he taunted him about the murder. Jimmy then shoved the glove into his face, where blood from his beaten mouth stained it. He then transferred some of the blood from the glove onto the knife, planting DNA evidence. Catherine tells him that, with all the new information, Jimmy is a suspect for the murder himself since he had a crush on Stephanie and even proposed to her a week before she was killed, though she turned him down. He refuses to give her a sample of his DNA without a warrant, which Catherine gets.||||| When the DNA test results come back, Jimmy is brought in for questioning. The test proves that the blood on the knife is not his, nor is it a match to anyone connected to the case or anyone in CODIS. Jimmy is furious when he learns that Catherine will make sure he is prosecuted to the full extent of the law, even though he could get life in prison or even the death penalty. He calls Catherine ungrateful, saying she would have started prostituting herself if he hadn't gotten her out of dancing. Catherine rebuts this, saying she earned her career as a CSI and only danced. She remarks that Jimmy sold his integrity to get a case solved and because of that, the real killer got away with it. She asks \"Between the two of us, who's the whore?\". She promises to follow Jimmy all the way through his proceedings and has him arrested. In the final scene of the episode, Catherine returns the Stephanie Watson evidence to the storage and marks the box \"DO NOT DESTROY - CASE UNSOLVED\".\n\n \n", "original_narrative": "Victim: Four victims (deceased) On the case: Gil Grissom, Nick Stokes, Sara Sidle\n\nGrissom, Nick and Sara arrive on the scene of a mass murder, four Buddhist monks from Thailand lay dead in their temple. Another monk, Ananda, who claims to have been at a bank depositing money they'd gathered to build a school during the murders, called for help. Each victim was shot between the eyes at close range, one at a time. A gang sign belonging to a gang known as \"The Snakebacks\" is carved into the wall. Grissom concludes that they sat still because they were praying for whoever shot them. In a temple garden, Grissom finds a potential murder weapon, a rifle.||||| When the room is processed, Sara extracts a recent boot print from the carpet floor, even though shoes are not supposed to be worn inside a Buddhist temple. She also finds a trace amount of a blue material on a statue and a used chewing gum on another. When Ananda's office is searched, the CSIs find a porn magazine, which is strange since Buddhism discourages seeking pleasure. The lab confirms that the rifle is the murder weapon. It also has Ananda's prints on it. At the autopsy, Doc Robbins explains that the area where all victims were shot corresponds to the Sixth Chakra. In Buddhism, the Chakras are the body's seven energy centers. The Sixth Chakra, also known as \"the Third Eye\", is the hub of higher consciousness. When Ananda is brought in for questioning, he explains that he found the rifle in his office and carried it outdoors because his faith doesn't allow weapons in the temple. The porn magazine was left in the temple by a visitor and Ananda kept it in case that person came back for it.||||| A further fingerprint analysis confirms that Ananda never touched the trigger of the gun; the locations of the prints are consistent with his story that he only carried the gun. Nick suspects that the gang sign is a false lead; after a number of murders, the LVPD came down hard on the Snakebacks and brought the whole gang down. Through David in autopsy, Grissom contacts a local Air Force base. Since 9/11, they keep satellite surveillance of bases and other key buildings. Since the temple is close to a base, it is within the range of a satellite. A photo shows a car with vanity plates \"PROUDUS\" outside the temple close to the time of the murders. The car is registered to Peter Hutchins Sr., a local diner owner who was unhappy with the monks having a temple so close to his establishment, blaming them for the drop in local stores' business. Inside the car, Sara finds a set of prayer beads that doesn't belong to Hutchins Sr.||||| At the lab, the CSIs learn that Peter Hutchins Sr. has an alibi for the murders. Greg examines the blue substance found on a statue and determines that it is paintball paint. Grissom, Nick and Sara visit a nearby paintball field, where Hutchins' son, Pete Hutchins Jr., is playing. Sara compares a shoe print left by his boot to the boot print found on the scene and sees that it is similar. Pete is brought in for questioning, accompanied by his father, and denies having been to the temple.||||| When pressured with the boot print, Pete claims to have brought some friends in to look into the rumors that there was money and drugs inside. When Grissom remarks that the lab's dust lifter only works on recent prints, Pete confesses that a friend took a gold statue from the temple when they were there. He went there to return it and found the monks as he was taking off his boots. He didn't call the police because he was afraid that he would become a suspect. When Grissom asks how he knew he was supposed to remove his boots when entering the temple, Pete admits, to his father's shame, to being interested in Buddhism and considering the monks his friends.||||| With Pete cleared, Greg examines the chewing gum found on a statue and finds trace amounts of curry and saffron on it. Grissom consults with Ananda and presents the lab's findings to him. The spices found on the gum suggest that someone ate them and then chewed the gum. Ananda shows Grissom the temple's kitchen, the cooking of which uses curry and saffron. O'Riley confronts the two with some new evidence: even though the monks raised ca. $13 000 for their charity project, Ananda only deposited $12 000 when he was at the bank. The account was opened the same day as the murders were committed.||||| Before that, Ananda kept the money in a box in his office. Grissom examines the box and finds curry powder inside. Suspicion falls on the temple's part-time cook, David Suddahara, whom Ananda caught stealing from the charity fund, which is why Ananda opened a bank account to keep the money safe. In interrogation, Suddahara confesses to the murders and Grissom confirms that his DNA matches that from the chewing gum from the scene. He thought Ananda was going to report him, went home, got his rifle and returned. Finding that Ananda was gone, he panicked and executed the monks, one by one. When Grissom asks Suddahara why he shot the monks in the Sixth Chakra, he only replies \"I shot them between the eyes.\" With the case closed, Grissom pays a visit to the temple and sees Pete Hutchins Jr. engaged in meditation with a monk.||||| Victim: Stephanie Watson (deceased) On the case: Catherine Willows, Warrick Brown In a separate storyline, Catherine meets up with Jimmy Tadero, her old mentor, at bar.

The film opens on Markham, his wife Jean (Meg Foster), his young son Tommy (William Rodriguez), and his daughter Heather (Yara Vaneau) having a picnic on the edge of the jungle, which is being cleared for the dam's construction. Tommy wanders from the cleared area, and an Indian (Rui Polanah) from one of the indigenous tribes known as the Invisible People notices Tommy and takes him. Markham pursues the pair into the forest but does not find his son. Ten years later, the dam is nearing completion. A 17-year-old Tommy (Charley Boorman), now called Tomme, has become one of the Invisible People. When his father, Chief Wanadi, the man who took and adopted Tommy, notices Tomme is now smitten with girls, he initiates Tomme's coming-of-age rite, after which Tomme undergoes a vision quest. Tomme's spirit animal tells him he must retrieve sacred stones from a remote spot deep in the jungle. Wanadi warns him that the quest will be dangerous, as it will take him into the territory of the cannibalistic Fierce People.||||| Meanwhile, Markham has finally identified his son's abductors. Markham and a journalist decide to set off bottle rockets to attract the attention of the Invisible People. Instead, they attract the Fierce People and are captured. Armed with a CAR-15 carbine, Markham is able to defend himself long enough to talk with Chief Jacareh (Claudio Moreno) who releases Markham for the night, promising to hunt him down in the morning, while the Fierce People kill and butcher the journalist. Close to dawn, Markham stumbles into Tomme collecting the sacred stones. The two recognize each other just as the Fierce People arrive, shooting Markham in the shoulder.

The Governor beats up Milton after learning he burnt the walker pits and betrayed him. The Governor offers Milton a knife and tells him he can get back into his good graces by killing Andrea, but Milton turns and tries to kill The Governor instead. The Governor grabs the knife and stabs Milton several times, fatally wounding him. He leaves Milton to die, expecting him to reanimate and kill Andrea, noting that \"In this life now, you kill or you die. Or you die and you kill\". The Governor then goes to join the army of men ready to attack the prison. Tyreese (Chad L.

However, Rick and the others are hiding in the tombs, and ambush The Governor and his men who flee in a confused panic.

Tara injures her leg in a run-in with some walkers, but Glenn wants to push forward. Rosita comes to her defense, noting Tara will do anything that Glenn says. Glenn negotiates a deal: the group continues walking until sundown, at which point Glenn will give Eugene his walking gear before going off on his own. Abraham agrees. Unfortunately, they soon come to train tunnel. Going around will take a day.||||| Naturally, Glenn refuses to wait so Abraham declares that they'll part ways now. It's simply too dangerous to Eugene -- to them all. Glenn and Tara head into the tunnel. Daryl and his new gang find an abandoned warehouse full of cars. All the gas is gone -- someone beat them to it -- but it does provide a good place to rest. The gang all \"claim\" cars in which to sleep before Daryl can, leaving him to recline on the ground. He doesn't seem to mind. In the tunnel, Glenn and Tara come across dozens of walkers trapped in what appears to be a minor cave-in. They do some stabbing and then climb over the bodies, revealing dozens and dozens more.||||| Glenn and Tara take to the high ground on top of a rock pile. \"We have to find another way,\" Tara says. Even Glenn finds it difficult to argue with that one. So they try to slip around the walkers, sneaking down the side of the rock pile. Unfortunately, Tara slips and gets her leg wedged in some rocks. Outside, Eugene, Abraham and Rosita discover a working car. Eugene convinces Rosita to let him navigate. With Abraham asleep in the back seat, Eugene and Rosita drive until the he demands that she stop ... right at the mouth of the tunnel exit. Eugene has calculated that, if Glenn and Tara traveled at around 3 MPH, they would either nearby or just about to emerge from the tunnel. Rosita explains that the priority is getting Eugene to Washington, not waiting for Glenn and Tara. \"After the I save the world, I still have to live with myself,\" Eugene says.||||| In the warehouse, Len discovers his half of rabbit is missing and accuses Daryl. \"You take his rabbit, Daryl?\" Joe asks. \"Tell me the truth.\" Joe empties Daryl's bag and, sure enough, there is the rabbit. Daryl accuses Len of planting the rabbit. Joe seems unsure -- and then punches Len in the face. \"I saw him do it,\" Joe says with a shrug. As punishment for breaking one of the cardinal rules, the group starts to beat Len with a brutal series of punches and kicks. It continues and continues. In the tunnel, Glenn refuses to leave Tara. They are about to be devoured when suddenly car lights appear. Then, a volley of gunfire cuts down all the walkers.||||| One of the gunmen is none other than Maggie. She hugs, cries and kisses Glenn. Glenn hugs, cries and kisses back. Later, it is revealed that Maggie is with Rosita, Abraham and Eugene. Bob and Sascha are there, too. Glenn then covers for Tara, hiding the fact that she was once side-by-side with the Governor. The entire group agrees to go to Terminus to see if their loved ones are there/look for supplies. After that, Abraham, Eugene, Rosita and whomever else will continue on to Washington. The next morning, Daryl exits the warehouse to find a badly beaten Len in the dirt with an arrow in his eye. He continues with Joe and the group to Terminus. Speaking of, Glenn and Maggie's group come upon a large building at the end of the railroad tracks. Terminus. Outside are plants growing in well-kept gardens. Inside, a middle-aged woman named Mary greets them with a smile. \"Let's get you settled ...

The priest knows who Steve is by letters he had written to Paolo talking about a woman named Nina, and asks Steve to tell him about the war. Steve relates what happened in 1944, when Italy was still occupied by the Germans: As a fighter pilot and squadron leader in Corsica, Steve completes his 200th mission and is about to be shipped home. When his replacement and good friend, Captain George Peterson, does not return from a mission needed for the impending invasion of Italy, Steve decides to take his place the next day. The squad cannot identify their strategic target, a tunnel that houses a German munitions supply, and Steve is forced to parachute out of his plane after it is hit.||||| Although the German ground soldiers see Steve's descent, he eludes them and seeks help from a local farmer. The farmer's wife fears the Germans and turns him away, but Steve is soon approached by Nina, a young woman who is part of an Italian guerrilla force. Nina leads Steve to a mountain cabin where he meets Bruno, leader of the small band. Although he is a patriot, Bruno fears that Steve's presence will bring severe retaliations against the villagers, including his mother, and tells Steve that he will have to stay put before finding his way back to Corsica. A few days later, Steve sees a formation of American planes fly overhead and realizes that the target still eludes them. He and Nina, who are attracted to each other, kiss, even though Steve has told her that he has a girl at home. Later, Steve tells Bruno that he is planning to leave that night.||||| Although Aldo, an embittered member of the band who is in love with Nina, lashes out at Steve, Bruno defends him and agrees to help. In the afternoon, the men go down from the hills, stop a German Panzer with a grenade and steal its weapons. A few minutes later, a truck full of German soldiers arrives, but the Italians manage to escape. Back at the cabin, Steve tells the men about the tunnel, but Bruno and the others are afraid that if they help, German retaliation will be too severe. Nina lashes out at the men for being too afraid to take chances, then leaves the cabin. Steve follows her and kisses her, promising that he will be with her even after the war, but telling her that she cannot come with him now. She agrees, but asks him to wait until morning when Father Paolo, who is a fearless patriot, can help him.||||| The next day, Nina takes Steve to see Fr. Paolo, who has been hiding George in the church since he was shot down. Paolo then reveals that Bruno's mother died when she fell from a truck, trying to escape from the Germans. Just then, two German soldiers barge in, with guns drawn. Nina distracts the soldiers by screaming, and in the melee, the Germans are killed. George, Nina and Steve then return to the cabin. On the way, they see a German roadblock and Nina distracts the soldiers long enough for George and Steve to capture them. That night, at the cabin, Nina tells Bruno what happened to his mother and he decides to help Steve blow up the tunnel.||||| During the planning, they observe that Aldo is gone, and when he returns carrying a goat, Nina is suspicious because Aldo hates goats. Later, the men notice an unusually large number of German patrols. At the same time, two of the men, Mario and Ettore, are captured by the Germans while getting supplies. Although Ettore is killed, Mario escapes. Meanwhile, at the cabin, Bruno begins to suspect that there is a spy in the group. Just then Mario comes back and tells them what happened.

Dr. Ranbir Sartain, Michael's new psychiatrist after Dr. Loomis' death, inform them that Michael is able to speak, but chooses not to.||||| Dana records the event as Aaron approaches Michael and talks to him, but fails to get him to speak, even after showing him his mask and mentioning Laurie Strode. The two journalists leave Smith's Grove Sanitarium and drive to Laurie's house, a heavily fortified and decrepit homestead, and bribe her for an interview, which she reluctantly accepts. Laurie has spent the last forty years dealing with post-traumatic stress and preparing for Michael's inevitable return. Her feelings have resulted in two failed marriages and losing custody of her daughter Karen at a young age. Aaron and Dana tell Laurie their interest in finding out why Michael committed the murders in 1978 and ask her to meet with him in a final attempt to get him to speak before he's transferred to a maximum security prison.

In class, Allyson looks out of the window to see Laurie watching her.||||| She meets with her grandmother who gives her the three thousand dollars from Aaron and Dana and tells her to have fun.

Dr. Ranbir Sartain, Michael's new psychiatrist after Dr. Loomis' death, inform them that Michael is able to speak, but chooses not to.||||| Dana records the event as Aaron approaches Michael and talks to him, but fails to get him to speak, even after showing him his mask and mentioning Laurie Strode. The two journalists leave Smith's Grove Sanitarium and drive to Laurie's house, a heavily fortified and decrepit homestead, and bribe her for an interview, which she reluctantly accepts. Laurie has spent the last forty years dealing with post-traumatic stress and preparing for Michael's inevitable return. Her feelings have resulted in two failed marriages and losing custody of her daughter Karen at a young age. Aaron and Dana tell Laurie their interest in finding out why Michael committed the murders in 1978 and ask her to meet with him in a final attempt to get him to speak before he's transferred to a maximum security prison. Laurie kicks them out of her house, but not before taking the money they offered.||||| Allyson with her friends As the transport is being prepared and patients are loaded onto the bus, Dr. Sartain insists on accompanying Michael, and the bus departs. In Haddonfield, Laurie's granddaughter and Karen's daughter, Allyson, is walking to school with two friends and tells them the stress that her family endures due to her grandmother's past, and debunks the town rumor that Michael is Laurie's brother. In class, Allyson looks out of the window to see Laurie watching her.||||| She meets with her grandmother who gives her the three thousand dollars from Aaron and Dana and tells her to have fun. During a family dinner at Karen's house, Laurie arrives and has a panic attack and Allyson comforts her.

Lorena suggests swapping partners and they are interested. Sam, who is falling head over heels for Daphne, asks about the scar on her back. She doesn't know what exactly did it to her. Tara and Eggs work on a broken hot water heater. An extremely grouchy Maryann is in need of a hot shower and finally lets them take her car to get a part.||||| Steve and Sarah have Jason and Luke start work on a platform. The stage is for a Meet the Sun ceremony, where a vampire is to be chained to the cross and allowed to burn in the morning sun. As they discuss a gameplan for meeting Steve and Sarah, Hugo mentions that Isabel has not been receptive to turning him. Hugo is worried that 50 years from now Isabel won't be able to love an aging mortal. Sookie admits to never having considered the option. On the way to get the part, Eggs begins to recognize the landscape, despite never having been on the road before. He has Tara stop the car and walks into the woods. Arlene tells Terry she has a surprise planned for him later that night. Andy shows up at Merlotte's and questions Lafayette about where he was the previous weeks. As the questioning gets more intense, a terrified Lafayette begins to see Eric's head on Andy's shoulders and shrinks into the corner.||||| Terry pushes his cousin away and helps Lafayette relax. Hoyt approaches his mother, who is having dinner with another woman. She has shut off his cellular 'phone and he is worried Jessica will think he's not interested. Sam suggests to Daphne that the two of them go for a run. While working on the platform, Jason and Luke talk about abstinence, adultery and various levels of sinning. Hugo and Sookie ride up and are met by Sarah. Sookie and Hugo (using fake names) pretend to be engaged and tell Sarah and Steve their previous pastor was a vampire-sympathizer. They would like to get married at Light of Day. Sookie overhears Steve thinking about a vampire in the basement he is preparing to kill. Back to the flashback: Lorena and Bill have turned the tables on the couple. Lorena forces the man to watch as Bill take a bite out of his wife. Lorena breaks the man's neck and the vampire couple has sex on the blood-soaked bed next to the dying woman.||||| Though he doesn't know why, Eggs takes Tara to a remote spot several miles into the woods. There are blood-soaked rocks in a circular formation. Eggs thinks he's been there before but isn't sure how that could be possible. He is overcome by emotion and Tara leads him away. During a tour of the church Sookie hears that Steve and Sara clearly are aware what she and Hugo are up to. Steve summons Gabe (the drill sergeant from last episode) to join them. Andy briefly chases the animal forms of Sam and Daphne. Sam is curious that Andy seemed to recognize Daphne in her pig form but she blows him off. Pam surprises Lafayette in the kitchen. She tells the confused man that he now must go back to selling \"V.\" Steve wants to take Sookie and Hugo to the basement, while Sarah suggest otherwise. Sookie knows what's happening but can't prevent Hugo and Gabe from dragging them downstairs.||||| Back in Dallas Bill senses that Sookie is in trouble. As he tries to get up from the bed Lorena overpowers him and holds him down, which, as his maker, she able to accomplish. Tara and Eggs return home to find the place a mess. Clothes are strewn everywhere. They walk out into the backyard and find a massive orgy taking place with a vibrating Maryann at the center. Jessica wakes up to find no word from Hoyt. She angrily starts dumping bottles of True Blood into the hotel sink when there is a knock on the door. It is Hoyt, who has driven to Dallas to tell her what happened with his phone. They embrace. Jason finds a sobbing Sarah alone in the church.||||| Steve is no longer the man she though he was, she says.

Lorena approaches and we learn he has invited her to town. Isabel and her human boyfriend, Hugo, arrive at Bill and Sookie's hotel room. The plan is for Hugo and Sookie to pretend to be a couple and infiltrate Light of Day. Back in the bar Eric makes it clear that Bill is in the way of his getting to Sookie. As his maker, Eric is hoping she will have pull over Bill. This leads to a 1926 flashback: Bill plays the piano while Lorena flirts with a Chicago couple. Lorena suggests swapping partners and they are interested. Sam, who is falling head over heels for Daphne, asks about the scar on her back. She doesn't know what exactly did it to her. Tara and Eggs work on a broken hot water heater. An extremely grouchy Maryann is in need of a hot shower and finally lets them take her car to get a part.||||| Steve and Sarah have Jason and Luke start work on a platform. The stage is for a Meet the Sun ceremony, where a vampire is to be chained to the cross and allowed to burn in the morning sun. As they discuss a gameplan for meeting Steve and Sarah, Hugo mentions that Isabel has not been receptive to turning him. Hugo is worried that 50 years from now Isabel won't be able to love an aging mortal. Sookie admits to never having considered the option. On the way to get the part, Eggs begins to recognize the landscape, despite never having been on the road before. He has Tara stop the car and walks into the woods. Arlene tells Terry she has a surprise planned for him later that night. Andy shows up at Merlotte's and questions Lafayette about where he was the previous weeks. As the questioning gets more intense, a terrified Lafayette begins to see Eric's head on Andy's shoulders and shrinks into the corner.||||| Terry pushes his cousin away and helps Lafayette relax. Hoyt approaches his mother, who is having dinner with another woman. She has shut off his cellular 'phone and he is worried Jessica will think he's not interested. Sam suggests to Daphne that the two of them go for a run. While working on the platform, Jason and Luke talk about abstinence, adultery and various levels of sinning. Hugo and Sookie ride up and are met by Sarah. Sookie and Hugo (using fake names) pretend to be engaged and tell Sarah and Steve their previous pastor was a vampire-sympathizer. They would like to get married at Light of Day. Sookie overhears Steve thinking about a vampire in the basement he is preparing to kill. Back to the flashback: Lorena and Bill have turned the tables on the couple. Lorena forces the man to watch as Bill take a bite out of his wife. Lorena breaks the man's neck and the vampire couple has sex on the blood-soaked bed next to the dying woman.||||| Though he doesn't know why, Eggs takes Tara to a remote spot several miles into the woods. There are blood-soaked rocks in a circular formation. Eggs thinks he's been there before but isn't sure how that could be possible. He is overcome by emotion and Tara leads him away. During a tour of the church Sookie hears that Steve and Sara clearly are aware what she and Hugo are up to. Steve summons Gabe (the drill sergeant from last episode) to join them. Andy briefly chases the animal forms of Sam and Daphne. Sam is curious that Andy seemed to recognize Daphne in her pig form but she blows him off. Pam surprises Lafayette in the kitchen. She tells the confused man that he now must go back to selling \"V.\" Steve wants to take Sookie and Hugo to the basement, while Sarah suggest otherwise. Sookie knows what's happening but can't prevent Hugo and Gabe from dragging them downstairs.||||| Back in Dallas Bill senses that Sookie is in trouble. As he tries to get up from the bed Lorena overpowers him and holds him down, which, as his maker, she able to accomplish. Tara and Eggs return home to find the place a mess. Clothes are strewn everywhere. They walk out into the backyard and find a massive orgy taking place with a vibrating Maryann at the center. Jessica wakes up to find no word from Hoyt. She angrily starts dumping bottles of True Blood into the hotel sink when there is a knock on the door. It is Hoyt, who has driven to Dallas to tell her what happened with his phone. They embrace. Jason finds a sobbing Sarah alone in the church.||||| Steve is no longer the man she though he was, she says. Sarah tells Jason that Steve is planning to start a war, and not training an army for protection. She convinces him that she no longer married \"in my heart\" and that Jesus wants them to be together. They start ripping each other's clothes off.

{"Prompt": "Suppose you are a story-reteller, generate a list of main concepts to help me understand the story.\n\nStory: It's only been a few months since officer Durai Singam arrested Danny, and Singam is called into Vishakapatnam, Andra Pradesh by it's Home Minister to solve the long pending murder case of Commissioner Ramakrishna as the new Deputy Commissioner of Police. When Singam arrives in Vizag he's attacked at the train station by the goon Gun Ravi, who works for Vizag's most powerful don and buisness owner Madasudhana Reddy. Singam defeats Ravi's men and Ravi is scolded by Reddy for assaulting a police officer unnecessarily.||||| Singam heads to Vizag's police station and meets Inspector Subbo Rao, officer Srinivas, and Constable Veeram. Veeram used to live in Thoothikudi and is a big fan of Singam, confirming that Bhai and Danny are currently in prison while Thangaraj has been killed. Veeram asks Singam about his marriage but the other officers are confused since he stated he was unmarried. Singam tells Veeram that he and his wife Kavya are divorced, which is later revealed as a cover to keep her protected. Kavya also visits the station and Singam pretends not to no her. Singam is also visited by Vidya, a fangirl who asks for his autograph at the train station. When Vidya makes frequent visits to Singam it bugs him and he dismisses her. Veeram and Vidya become friends in their common interests.||||| Reddy calls his higher authority Vittal Prasad, a buisnessman stationed in Sydney, Australia who ships wastage from medical and electronic companies in exchange for free steal supplies for his company Vittal Steals. Vittal confronts his friend Steve for signing an oppositional agreement against him and beats up his wife in retaliation. Vittal calls his father, the Aviation Minister Ram Prasad to investigate Durai Singam when he gets update of his presence by Reddy. Back in Vizag, Singam fights a group of Reddy's men who threaten a custom's officer for blocking Reddy's shipment containers from Australia.||||| Singam calls Reddy himself and covers the attack claiming to be his secret ally, and begins to investigate the case and inquires Ramakrishna's family. The commissioner's wife states that he attended a murder call and was killed on that night. She sends Singam away when he tries to talk to her daughters, stating that Krisharaj, the assistant commissioner touched them innappropriatly when he came to inquire. Krishnaraj also told Singam earlier that he had no knowledge of Ramakrishna calling him. A confused Singam hires a hacker named Murili to hack into the cell company's network and find that a call took place for a few seconds during the Commissioner's murder to a man named Mallaya. Vidya later pays visit to Singam claiming to be a student for a police academy and simply wishes to learn from him.||||| A constable in the station falls sick mysteriously. After investigation, Singam, Subbo, and Srinivas find that the medicine tablet was sold without a permit under Reddy's authority and that the medicine originates from Australia. Singam pays visit to Bheemli Selvam, one of Reddy's men who authorized the attack at the train station. Suspecting him of murdering the Commissioner Singam searches his house and finds Australian money and a firearm. Reddy calls Singam and assures him that Selvam is permitted to have them. Vittal is also informed of the arrest by Rajeev Krishna, who works with Reddy and owns Vizag Scraps company.||||| Veeram and Srinivas show Singam an article written about him being a corrupt extortionist threatening Reddy, written by an author Agni who's revealed to be Vidya. Vidya is actually a journalist hired to write a thrilling story in Vizag and she chooses to portray Singam as such. Singam's family and Home Minister Ramnathan are confused by the article and Reddy suggests to Singam to keep his head down. Singam is called and informed that the same people who killed the commissioner also murdered security guards around the same time as found by a forensic officer. Singam pays visit to Mallaya, Ramakrishna's driver who confirms that Reddy baited Ramakrishna to the harbor and shot him. He never told anyone since he was caught and threatened with death to him and his family. Murili also confirms that the phone company had the call history on that night erased. Singam deduces that somebody other than Reddy helped him murder the commissioner.||||| The next day, Singam sends the entire force of Vizag to arrest every suspected criminal in the city including a great deal of Reddy's men. After shooting Selvam, Vidya begins to regret writing about Singam in the way she did. Reddy initially tolerates Singam's arrests but becomes suspicious when he takes too many of his men.

The police also identify the unnamed visitor to the station a few days ago from the funeral footage, as a local school teacher.||||| Singam interrogates the teacher, who confirms that he knows of the cause. Weeks before Ramakrishna was killed, his grandchildren as well as 32 students died from a smog attack from the local dump which was burning trash. Singam heads to the city dumps and finds Australian medicine, hospital wastage and electronic components. Singam puts the events that have passed together and realizes that Reddy makes living off of importing Australian waste into Vizag and has killed Ramakrishna to protect it, and deduces that Reddy is working with someone in Australia to help him. Reddy, Rajeev, and Vittal all find out about his revelation and Reddy sends Ravi to kill Singam and the school teacher.

Vittal calls him anonymously with Reddy and Rajeev on the line and threatens to kill Singam's family if he continues with the case.||||| The next day Singam decides he must get to the bottom of who Reddy's boss is. He starts with chasing down and arresting Ravi. He barges into Reddy's house and arrests him for all that he's done but he's only sentenced to two weeks of prison.

Singam leaves Australia immediatly and Vittal fails to capture him. When Singam returns he finds Reddy paroled for Ramakrishna's murder when three of his goons claim to be responsible and that their supposed motivation was Ramakrishna attempting to rape one of their wives.

Vittal gets wind of Singam's rise in power and heads to India to confront him. Vittal tells Singam to stay out of his way, and Singam responds by intercepting Reddy and having Subbu shoot him since Reddy started a riot in Ram Prasad's favor six years earlier, which killed Subbu's son.||||| Singam reveals Vittal's containers to the press and threatens to give all evidence away to the public if Vittal doesn't pay him visit. Singam angrily scolds Vittal on how his buisness has hurt people but decides to give him another chance for his employee's sake.

Concerned by these developments, Dolores tries to have the local Catholic priest, Father Frank Adamsky, bless the house, but an argument breaks out within the family shortly after Adamsky arrives. After Anthony shouts and hits the younger children, Adamsky tries to intervene but Anthony rudely orders him to leave. To Dolores' mortification, Adamsky leaves, disgusted at Anthony's behavior. He finds his car door open and the Bible on the passenger seat torn to pieces. The situation inside the home continues to deteriorate; Anthony is shown to be strict, abusive, sacrilegious towards the Catholic faith, violent towards his family and forcing his wife to have sex with him against her will. Dolores tries to keep things together for the youngest children. Also, Sonny and Patricia are revealed to have started to have sexual feelings for each other, due to mutual attraction that neither can act on.||||| The family goes to church with Anthony, so he can apologize for being rude to Adamsky.

On Sonny's birthday, he isolates himself from his birthday party, calls Patricia and she goes to check on him. She tells him she does not feel guilty about what they have been doing, but due to his demonic phases and his body's gradual demonic contortions, Sonny sends her away, using foul language. Patricia runs away crying, and she tries to tell Adamsky that she thinks Sonny is possessed, but he does not respond. Later that night, the evil spirit tells Sonny to \"kill them all\". Sonny goes and gets his father's rifle, and shoots his parents, Jan, Mark, and Patricia, after hunting her down.||||| The next day the cops arrive, pick up the bodies, and Sonny is arrested.

As high school senior Bianca Piper (Mae Whitman) explains, now jocks play video games, the princesses are on anti-depressants, and the nerds are in charge. We then see the short, slightly-overweight unattractive Bianca walking down the halls with her two attractive best friends: Jessica 'Jess' Harris (Skyler Samuels), an aspiring fashion designer, and Casey Cordero (Bianca A. Santos), a tough computer hacker girl. All the guys drool over Jess and Casey, but nobody ever really acknowledges Bianca. The school's ruthless mean-girl queen bee Madison Morgan (Bella Thorne) invites Jess and Casey to a party at her house, and deliberately chooses not to invite Bianca, until Casey makes it so that there's a free invitation. Here, we also meet Bianca's neighbor and former friend Wesley Rush (Robbie Amell), captain of the football team and Madison's on/off boyfriend. Bianca also has a crush on a guy named Toby Tucker (Nick Eversman), but she is too scared to say more than two words to him.||||| The supervisor of the school newspaper and Bianca's teacher, Mr. Arthur (Ken Jeong), assigns her the task of writing an article for the school newspaper on the upcoming homecoming dance and what social life means to her. She reluctantly agrees to it. At home, we meet Bianca's mom Dottie (Allison Janney), who became a successful author after her divorce. She was inspired by an episode of \"The Simpsons\" to create a book on the five stages of dealing with divorce.||||| She, along with Jess and Casey, convince Bianca to go to the party, despite her hesitance. At the party, Wes runs into Bianca and asks her if Jess and Casey have mentioned him or are interested in him. Bianca says it's not her job to divulge information on her friends, to which Wes argues that it is as their DUFF. Wes explains to a confused Bianca that it stands for the \"Designated Ugly Fat Friend\", and that a DUFF is there to make their friends look better by comparison. They are approachable enough for someone to ask them about their hot friends, and Bianca fits this role. Offended, she throws her drink in Wes's face. She goes home alone feeling insecure and self-conscious.||||| Throughout the rest of the day, the thought of being a DUFF bugs Bianca until she realizes that everyone only talks to her to get closer to Jess and Casey. She even notices all the other social cliques at school with their own DUFF. It gets to a point where Bianca confronts Jess and Casey about being their DUFF. Despite their assurance that they don't see her like that, Bianca spitefully unfollows them from every form of social media (Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Vine, etc.) and decides she doesn't want to be friends with them at all. Bianca notices that Wes is failing chemistry. She sees this as an opportunity for the two of them to help each other out. She offers to tutor Wes if he agrees to turn her image around so that she won't be a DUFF. Wes agrees, but only if Bianca asks him in her monster voice from when they were kids. She does.||||| Wes joins Bianca at the local shopping mall where he first gets her to dress in a more flattering manner. As Bianca tries on different outfits, she fools around with a mannequin and pretends it's Toby. From afar, Madison's minion Caitlyn (Rebecca Weil) films this and sends the video to Madison. Wes then challenges Bianca to go around the mall and talk to a bunch of random guys for her to get over her fear of talking to Toby. It goes awkwardly for a while until one guy from a frozen yogurt stand talks to Bianca for a while. The next day, the video of Bianca at the mall goes viral throughout the school. Everybody points and laughs at her, forcing her to run into the bathroom and cry. Mr. Arthur and Principal Buchanon (Romany Malco) take notice of this and demand everybody turn in their cell phones to prevent further cyberbullying, which only turns everyone against Bianca even more since they blame her for the loss of their gadgets. Jess and Casey also see the video, and Casey gets rid of the video. The phones are returned to the students when the constant ringing bothers Buchanon.||||| Wes comes over to Bianca's house to apologize for not stopping the video and for not defending her. He gives her a dress that she had her eye on at the mall. He tells her not to let the video get to her and that she should approach Toby personally and admit how she feels. Wes then promises to go out and continue studying. Bianca approaches Toby at school after being previously humiliated by the video. She tells him she's into him, and he invites her to go over to his house to hang out. Bianca takes Wes into the nearby woods to her \"thinking rock\" so he can tell her how to handle herself on a date. He explains how the mood should be set and how Toby would act if he is trying to go for a kiss. Wes ends up kissing Bianca, but they laugh it off as just practice.

Madison then approaches Bianca at school the next day and threatens to post another video at the mall of Bianca's awkward encounter with the guys since Madison doesn't like Bianca hanging around Wes.||||| Another evening or two later, Bianca goes to Toby's house for dinner. He puts out sushi and talks about how he got into writing songs. However, Bianca cannot stop thinking about Wes. She goes to the bathroom and tries to convince herself that she's not into him. Outside, Toby plays an awkwardly-written song for Bianca and then asks about Jess and Casey. Bianca slowly realizes that Toby is DUFF-ing her, and he admits he only invited Bianca over because he thought Jess and Casey would be joining them.

{"Prompt": "Suppose you are a story-reteller, generate a list of main concepts to help me understand the story.\n\nStory: The opening scene depicts Anita \"Needy\" Lesnicky (Amanda Seyfriend), a violent inmate in a correctional facility. She is notorious for being a 'kicker', and is now reflecting during lockdown on past events. Needy is a nerdy, substantially unpopular, \"plain Jane\" type student from Devil's Kettle, Minnesota, who has been best friends with Jennifer Check (Megan Fox), a beautiful, popular cheerleader, since their childhood. Needy's feelings toward Jennifer border on attraction. One evening, Jennifer has Needy accompany her to Melody Lane, a local bar, where an indie rock band named Low Shoulder is playing.||||| It seems unlikely that they would bother to perform in such a small town, but frontman Nikolai Wolf (Adam Brody) explains that it is a service to their fans. As Jennifer is fetching them drinks (getting past the age restriction barrier by flirting with the bartender), Needy overhears Nikolai referring to her as the \"State Fair Butter Queen\" - she loves to flirt and act promiscuously, but is in truth a virgin. During the performance, the bar catches on fire. Nikolai gazes on with a smirk, and Needy leads Jennifer to safety through the toilet window, just barely escaping from being killed in the blaze. Outside, they are accosted by the band, who made it out okay. Jennifer is in shock and Nikolai offers to lead them to \"somewhere safe\" in his van. Jennifer agrees in spite of Needy's protests and leaves with the band. Needy watches as the remains of the bar collapses to the ground.||||| Needy eventually makes it home where she finds a note from her divorced mother, stating that she is working swing shift this evening. Needy calls her boyfriend Chip (Johnny Simmons) to tell him what happened, and expresses her concern for Jennifer's safety. A bruised, bleeding Jennifer suddenly appears in Needy's home with torn clothing. Things get even stranger as Needy watches Jennifer tear wolfishly into a raw chicken in her fridge and monstrously roar at her, before spewing up a black, tar-like substance all over the floor. Jennifer further terrorizes Needy when she throws her against a wall and asks if she is scared of her. Jennifer then runs out the front door leaving a bewildered and frightened Needy behind.||||| The next day, the whole town mourns the tragedy of the bar fire, and Needy morosely remembers her childhood friend. Jennifer arrives at school acting as if nothing is wrong, and is completely unsympathetic to the victims of the fire. Jennifer meets up with the high school football captain, grieving the death of his best friend at the hands of the fire. She says his late friend suggested that they would have made a \"banging\" couple and leads him into the woods to ostensibly fulfill that request. As the two are kissing, her mouth transforms into a demonic gaping maw and she attacks him. Later that day, a highly-concerned teacher at the school finds the captain's grisly remains, and the town is rocked by the additional tragedy. Low Shoulder's song \"Through the Trees\" becomes a smashing success, and they donate 3% of their earnings to the cause of the victims. Needy questions the paltry effort, and wonders why they are credited with having rescued survivors while she herself knows that that is untrue.||||| A month passes by and Jennifer begins to look a little pale and gaunt, enigmatically explaining that \"it is wearing off\" and that she needs sustenance. Jennifer catches the eye of the school nerd Colin Gray (Kyle Gallner), and asks him to meet her at her house, though later making rude remarks to Needy about Colin's femininity and taste in music.||||| The next evening, Needy spends time with Chip, while Colin goes to meet Jennifer only to find that she has directed him to a still-in-construction house in a deserted neighborhood where she is in an upstairs room lit by various candles. Jennifer suddenly transforms into a snake-eyed humanoid creature, kills Colin, and sups on his flesh, as Needy has a vision of Jennifer that causes her to panic as Chip makes love to her. Needy drives home from Chip's house only to encounter Jennifer walking like an animal across the road before jumping onto her car's windshield. Needy returns home, only to find Jennifer sleeping in her bed and wearing one of Needy's shirts. They begin to passionately kiss until Needy snaps and demands to know what's happening. Needy orders Jennifer to leave, but Jennifer instead confesses what happened to her on the night the local bar burned down.||||| In a flashback sequence, Low Shoulder drove Jennifer out into a forested area, gleefully intending to offer her as a Satanic sacrifice in exchange for chart success. During the band's discussions, several wondered if Jennifer really was a virgin, which she insisted she was in the hopes that they would let her go. Using some instructions they downloaded off the internet, they spoke an incantation to the Devil, before stabbing her with a Bowie knife, which was then thrown into the notorious whirlpool off the nearby Devil's Kettle Falls.||||| Back in the present, Jennifer further explains to Needy that she found herself still alive (which Needy doubts), and then wandered away from the site after they had left, which is when Jennifer stumbled back to Needy's place that night. Jennifer also confides to Needy that when she is fully replenished with human flesh, she is indestructible. She demonstrates this by stabbing herself in the arm with a pocket knife, which immediately heals. Jennifer also tells Needy that on that same night, she came across the Indian exchange student that had survived the fire walking along the road, and devoured him and hid his body in the woods. Needy threatens to call the police, but Jennifer tells Needy that she will just deny everything and that no one will ever believe such a story. With that, Jennifer jumps out of Needy's second floor window and lands on the ground, completely uninjured, and runs off into the night.||||| Now more worried than ever, Needy goes to the occult section of their school's library and begins to do research. Needy soon finds where the band went wrong. Because Jennifer wasn't actually means a virgin, their sacrifice backfired - though it indeed brought them prosperity, it also turned Jennifer into a succubus, a female demon with a constant need to feed on young men to keep herself in good health. Needy realizes that the Spring Formal is approaching and that Jennifer could very well turn the dance into a bloodbath. She informs Chip about this and warns him not to attend the Formal, but he simply suggests that she get psychiatric help.||||| She breaks up with him in order to protect him, and he decides to attend in lieu of her warnings. The Spring Formal finally arrives, attended by Low Shoulder, who are now incredibly popular and have sold out a national tour. As they take the stage, Needy does not see Chip anywhere, so she leaves in pursuit of him. In the meanwhile, Jennifer confronts Chip in the woods, telling him that Needy was having an affair with Colin and that that was why she was so upset when the latter passed. Despite Chip affirming that he loves Needy, Jennifer kisses him ardently in an attempt to seduce him. She leads him to an abandoned mansion with a graffiti-filled indoor swimming pool. She kisses him again, but he rejects her yet again, causing her to throw him into the gunky water in a fit of rage.||||| Needy rushes towards the mansion to find a demonic, animalistic Jennifer and an injured Chip, still in the pool and suffering extensive blood loss due to Jennifer already having bitten him. Needy dives into the water to help Chip and maces Jennifer, causing her to vomit more black fluid. As Needy and Chip crawl out of the dirty swimming pool, Jennifer levitates above them. Needy confronts Jennifer about how she was never a good friend to her, and Jennifer threatens to kill her. Chip, uses the last of his energy to impale Jennifer through the stomach with a pool net's handle, before she escapes through a nearby window. Needy tries to call for help using Chip's phone, but it is damaged from being in the water. He dies in her arms, but not before the two profess their mutual love.||||| Needy wails as she mourns him. Needy, hell-bent on revenge, breaks into Jennifer's room, where she and her former best friend scuffle. Needy eventually yanks the \"Best Friends Forever\" locket from her former friend's neck and kills her by stabbing her through the heart with a box cutter. Jennifer's mother (Carrie Genzel) hears the noise and enters the bedroom to find Needy crouched over her daughter with the bloody knife. This results in Needy being taken to a mental institution. However, due to having been bitten by Jennifer during their fight, Needy has developed some demonic powers of her own, as well as Jennifer's evil personality - she has become vicious, ill-tempered, and anti-social with the orderlies and other residents. Isolated and abandoned by everyone she knows, she sets a plot in motion to escape. After a fight with an institution doctor, Needy is isolated in a cell. That night, she levitates herself to an overhead window, kicks it out with her superhuman strength, breaks through a nearby chain-link fence, and escapes into the night.||||| As she wanders down a rural road, she finds a watery runoff (which is where the nearby Devil Falls empties out into), along with the knife that Low Shoulder used to stab Jennifer, which she picks up. She flags down a passing vehicle and tells the driver she's following a band. The man exclaims that they must \"be one hell of a group,\" to which she then grimly explains that \"tonight's gonna be their last show.\" The end credits show Low Shoulder checking into a hotel post-concert and candidly indulging in drugs and alcohol in their hotel room. Eventually, the band is savagely murdered by a blurred figure. We then see police crime scene photos of the band members' corpses strewn around the hotel room, Nikolai having been stabbed in the chest with the sacrificial knife. The final image of the movie shows security camera footage of an evil-looking Needy walking down the hotel hallway past a gathering of female band groupies.\n\n \n", "original_narrative": "The opening scene depicts Anita \"Needy\" Lesnicky (Amanda Seyfriend), a violent inmate in a correctional facility.

Needy returns home, only to find Jennifer sleeping in her bed and wearing one of Needy's shirts. They begin to passionately kiss until Needy snaps and demands to know what's happening. Needy orders Jennifer to leave, but Jennifer instead confesses what happened to her on the night the local bar burned down.||||| In a flashback sequence, Low Shoulder drove Jennifer out into a forested area, gleefully intending to offer her as a Satanic sacrifice in exchange for chart success. During the band's discussions, several wondered if Jennifer really was a virgin, which she insisted she was in the hopes that they would let her go. Using some instructions they downloaded off the internet, they spoke an incantation to the Devil, before stabbing her with a Bowie knife, which was then thrown into the notorious whirlpool off the nearby Devil's Kettle Falls.||||| Back in the present, Jennifer further explains to Needy that she found herself still alive (which Needy doubts), and then wandered away from the site after they had left, which is when Jennifer stumbled back to Needy's place that night. Jennifer also confides to Needy that when she is fully replenished with human flesh, she is indestructible. She demonstrates this by stabbing herself in the arm with a pocket knife, which immediately heals. Jennifer also tells Needy that on that same night, she came across the Indian exchange student that had survived the fire walking along the road, and devoured him and hid his body in the woods. Needy threatens to call the police, but Jennifer tells Needy that she will just deny everything and that no one will ever believe such a story. With that, Jennifer jumps out of Needy's second floor window and lands on the ground, completely uninjured, and runs off into the night.||||| Now more worried than ever, Needy goes to the occult section of their school's library and begins to do research. Needy soon finds where the band went wrong. Because Jennifer wasn't actually means a virgin, their sacrifice backfired - though it indeed brought them prosperity, it also turned Jennifer into a succubus, a female demon with a constant need to feed on young men to keep herself in good health. Needy realizes that the Spring Formal is approaching and that Jennifer could very well turn the dance into a bloodbath. She informs Chip about this and warns him not to attend the Formal, but he simply suggests that she get psychiatric help.||||| She breaks up with him in order to protect him, and he decides to attend in lieu of her warnings. The Spring Formal finally arrives, attended by Low Shoulder, who are now incredibly popular and have sold out a national tour. As they take the stage, Needy does not see Chip anywhere, so she leaves in pursuit of him. In the meanwhile, Jennifer confronts Chip in the woods, telling him that Needy was having an affair with Colin and that that was why she was so upset when the latter passed. Despite Chip affirming that he loves Needy, Jennifer kisses him ardently in an attempt to seduce him. She leads him to an abandoned mansion with a graffiti-filled indoor swimming pool. She kisses him again, but he rejects her yet again, causing her to throw him into the gunky water in a fit of rage.||||| Needy rushes towards the mansion to find a demonic, animalistic Jennifer and an injured Chip, still in the pool and suffering extensive blood loss due to Jennifer already having bitten him. Needy dives into the water to help Chip and maces Jennifer, causing her to vomit more black fluid. As Needy and Chip crawl out of the dirty swimming pool, Jennifer levitates above them. Needy confronts Jennifer about how she was never a good friend to her, and Jennifer threatens to kill her. Chip, uses the last of his energy to impale Jennifer through the stomach with a pool net's handle, before she escapes through a nearby window. Needy tries to call for help using Chip's phone, but it is damaged from being in the water. He dies in her arms, but not before the two profess their mutual love.||||| Needy wails as she mourns him. Needy, hell-bent on revenge, breaks into Jennifer's room, where she and her former best friend scuffle. Needy eventually yanks the \"Best Friends Forever\" locket from her former friend's neck and kills her by stabbing her through the heart with a box cutter. Jennifer's mother (Carrie Genzel) hears the noise and enters the bedroom to find Needy crouched over her daughter with the bloody knife. This results in Needy being taken to a mental institution. However, due to having been bitten by Jennifer during their fight, Needy has developed some demonic powers of her own, as well as Jennifer's evil personality - she has become vicious, ill-tempered, and anti-social with the orderlies and other residents. Isolated and abandoned by everyone she knows, she sets a plot in motion to escape. After a fight with an institution doctor, Needy is isolated in a cell. That night, she levitates herself to an overhead window, kicks it out with her superhuman strength, breaks through a nearby chain-link fence, and escapes into the night.||||| As she wanders down a rural road, she finds a watery runoff (which is where the nearby Devil Falls empties out into), along with the knife that Low Shoulder used to stab Jennifer, which she picks up. She flags down a passing vehicle and tells the driver she's following a band. The man exclaims that they must \"be one hell of a group,\" to which she then grimly explains that \"tonight's gonna be their last show.\" The end credits show Low Shoulder checking into a hotel post-concert and candidly indulging in drugs and alcohol in their hotel room. Eventually, the band is savagely murdered by a blurred figure. We then see police crime scene photos of the band members' corpses strewn around the hotel room, Nikolai having been stabbed in the chest with the sacrificial knife.

At adjacent telephone booths in Grand Central Station, each calls family, then buys gifts for their spouses at Saks Fifth Avenue, and later visits friends. Over lunch, Frank's friend and colleague, Ed Lasky, reveals he is getting a divorce, and Molly learns that her friend, Isabelle, is going to Acapulco with her young boyfriend, David. In the evening, Frank and Molly shop at the bookstore, Rizzoli. As they leave the store with multiple shopping bags, their paths collide, when Molly realizes that Frank has mistakenly grabbed her package. Frank gives it to her, and they wish each other a Merry Christmas.||||| The next morning, Frank opens presents with his wife, Ann, and two sons, Mike and Joe, and after Ann unwraps The Big Book of Sailing, he is perplexed about what happened to the gardening book he bought her. Meanwhile, under Molly's Christmas tree, her husband Brian Gilmore, receives the gift, Gardens for All Seasons, and she is amused by the mix-up. Three months later on the Metro-North Commuter train, Frank notices Molly and attempts to figure out why she seems so familiar. As they disembark, Frank recalls that she is the woman from Rizzoli, and reminds her about dropping the Christmas packages. Molly says that she still has his book. In a nod to their previous meeting, they wish each other a Merry Christmas and go their separate ways. At work on a construction site in Manhattan, Frank's colleague, Victor Rawlins, encourages him to consider an opportunity in Houston, Texas, but Frank is reluctant to commit to the year-long job.||||| Molly visits her father, John Trainer, in the hospital, but has difficulty getting a straight answer from him about his health. Back at the construction site, Frank tells Ed about a woman he met on the train that morning, and meanwhile at Isabelle's office, while showing her latest illustrations, Molly mentions Frank. Despite their friends's goading, Molly and Frank downplay any significance; however, prior to boarding the train, Frank practices a dialogue he might have with Molly. On the train, Frank sees Molly looking for a seat and later approaches her standing near the door where they have an awkward conversation about being married and the curious fact of running into each other again. Tactfully, Frank suggests that they ride together tomorrow, and, Molly tells him that she plans to take the Friday, 9:04am train. That morning, Frank just makes the train, and Molly saves the seat next to her.||||| During the ride, he talks about his sons. Later that day, Frank arranges to meet Molly at the hospital and persuades her to have lunch, during which he does most of the talking. Although shy, Molly is engaged by his conversation and sense of humor. On another day, at a cafe in Grand Central Station, Molly speaks more openly, revealing that two years ago her newborn daughter died. Molly and Frank continue to get to know each during their commutes. Sometime later, while walking together in Manhattan, Isabelle suspects that Molly is seeing someone, based on her glowing appearance. Molly tries to explain that it is only a friendship, but her uneasiness indicates deeper feelings. Embarrassed, Molly abruptly walks away from Isabelle and telephones Frank. Molly and Frank spend that afternoon in Chinatown and have their picture taken together in an arcade photo booth. That evening during dinner with Brian, Molly appears preoccupied.||||| On another day, Molly hurries to the hospital to learn that her father had an arteriogram, and requires heart surgery. Molly is unable to reach her husband with the news, so she telephones Frank and goes to see him at the construction site. Frank recognizes that something is wrong. At first, Molly explains that her father is back in the hospital, but then proclaims, with ambivalence, that she has responsibilities and should not see Frank anymore. As she gets into a taxi, Frank asks her to wait for him at the station cafe at 5:45pm, prior to boarding the train. Delayed by work, Frank hurries to the station, only to miss the rendezvous. As the train pulls away, he turns around to see that Molly is waiting for him on the platform. He passionately kisses her and expresses his love. The next day, instead of taking his sons to a baseball game, Frank meets Molly at Rizzoli.||||| Despite their mutual doubts and anxiety, they go to Ed's empty apartment in Manhattan. They kiss, but as they move to the bed and begin to remove their clothes, Molly says she cannot continue and apologizes. They hold hands on the train home. At the Dobbs Ferry station, Molly watches from the train as Frank's wife and sons greet him. When she arrives home, Molly's husband says her father has died, and Frank learns the news when he tries to telephone Molly at the hospital. Overcome with grief and guilt, Molly becomes hysterical during the funeral, and her husband has a difficult time calming her. At home in bed, she relates to Isabelle that she cannot stop thinking about Frank, and that Brian assumes Molly is just distracted by the death of her father. Molly admits to Isabelle that she loves Frank and believes they are meant to be together even though she is resigned to the fact that they never will be.||||| While Ann fixes him dinner, Frank discusses the Houston job that he has finally accepted, but his wife senses that there is something else he is not telling her. Frank confesses that he met a woman on the train, but that it was only a friendship and nothing happened. Calmly, Ann says that she will take the kids to Denver for two weeks to see her mother, and then she slaps Frank. That evening, Frank drives to Molly's house and looks at it from his car. The night of his departure for Houston, he telephones Molly at home and says he misses her, asking if they can meet that evening.||||| Molly's husband enters the room, making it difficult for her to talk openly, so she says goodbye, wishing Frank a good trip. After she hangs up, her husband says, \"well, that's that,\" indicating he knows about Frank. Molly rushes out to catch Frank, despite Brian's pleading. Frank calls Molly again before getting in the taxi, but Brian answers, lying to Frank that Molly does not want to speak to him. In the pouring rain, Molly speeds along the road, slamming on brakes to avoid a train and stalling her car, thereby missing the opportunity to say goodbye. The following Christmas, Frank is visiting from Houston and meets Ed at a restaurant in Manhattan.||||| After Ed asks Frank to be the best man at his upcoming wedding, Frank reveals that he came back to arrange the sale of his house and that his marriage with Ann did not work out, so she returned to Denver. Meanwhile, Molly is also in Manhattan visiting with Isabelle, who encourages Molly to accept a job offer and insists that she should join her in Barbados, instead of spending Christmas alone. That evening, Frank enters Rizzoli and encounters Molly. During their polite but reserved exchange, Molly apologizes for not being able to say goodbye the night he left for Houston, and Frank says he should not have called. When asked about their families, neither discloses the state of their marriages. They wish each other a Merry Christmas and leave the bookstore, walking in opposite directions, but thinking about the other. Frank stops and runs down the sidewalk. At Grand Central Station, Molly boards the commuter train. During the journey, she sees Frank making his way towards her.

The night of his departure for Houston, he telephones Molly at home and says he misses her, asking if they can meet that evening.||||| Molly's husband enters the room, making it difficult for her to talk openly, so she says goodbye, wishing Frank a good trip. After she hangs up, her husband says, \"well, that's that,\" indicating he knows about Frank. Molly rushes out to catch Frank, despite Brian's pleading. Frank calls Molly again before getting in the taxi, but Brian answers, lying to Frank that Molly does not want to speak to him. In the pouring rain, Molly speeds along the road, slamming on brakes to avoid a train and stalling her car, thereby missing the opportunity to say goodbye. The following Christmas, Frank is visiting from Houston and meets Ed at a restaurant in Manhattan.||||| After Ed asks Frank to be the best man at his upcoming wedding, Frank reveals that he came back to arrange the sale of his house and that his marriage with Ann did not work out, so she returned to Denver. Meanwhile, Molly is also in Manhattan visiting with Isabelle, who encourages Molly to accept a job offer and insists that she should join her in Barbados, instead of spending Christmas alone. That evening, Frank enters Rizzoli and encounters Molly. During their polite but reserved exchange, Molly apologizes for not being able to say goodbye the night he left for Houston, and Frank says he should not have called. When asked about their families, neither discloses the state of their marriages. They wish each other a Merry Christmas and leave the bookstore, walking in opposite directions, but thinking about the other. Frank stops and runs down the sidewalk. At Grand Central Station, Molly boards the commuter train. During the journey, she sees Frank making his way towards her.

When they arrive, Sara ( Hilarie Burton ) is there. She and Neal reference the other night. They agree it was \"hot.\" Peter tells the team the plan is to take down Ponzi scheme perpetrator Vincent Adler (Andrew McCarthy). They know he is looking for U-Boat 869. The contents are unknown, but he's since he's searching for it off the New York coast, it means they can find him. Peter wants Diana ( Marsha Thomason ) and Jones ( Sharif Atkins ) to look for Alex ( Gloria Votsis ). After they leave, Neal tells Sara he and Alex are \"over.\" Mozzie ( Willie Garson ) wildly speculates about the contents of the sub. Mozzie has a way for them to locate the sub's SOS signal (the fractal.) Peter has Neal call Alex in an attempt to narrow the search area. Adler answers her phone saying only \"the lady doesn't want to be disturbed.\"||||| Locating Alex is now a higher priority. Mozzie has learned she was in town a few weeks ago trying to pawn more silver through a small-time crook named Teddy. Neal tells Peter that Teddy likes hot merchandise. Neal and Mozzie meet with Teddy. They bring along the Rolexes. Peter and Jones bust the \"deal\" and Neal pretends to help Teddy beat the search. Teddy now owes him one and says the last he knew Alex was headed to the Conservatory garden. Security tapes indicate Alex disappeared in the garden. Peter and Neal re-trace her steps in the garden. They lose track of each other. Back at the entrance, Peter gets a call. It's Adler telling him to get into a limo that now contains Neal. Inside the car, Peter is disarmed and instructed to unlock his anklet. Adler says he's taking them to Alex and has them drink a knockout drug.||||| They wake up to find Alex is in the same predicament they are. Alder walks in and opens the doors to reveal they are in a massive warehouse and the U-Boat itself is sitting right there. He says the U-Boat was scuttled after the war and the Germans were never able to come back for it. Adler's father was the lone surviving crew member, which is why he knows so much. The boat is riddled with explosive measures. Adler wants Neal to get inside for him. Alex is the insurance policy. Peter will be helping Neal. Sara goes to Neal's and finds Mozzie finishing up the SOS-detector. The both realize something is wrong since Neal is 30 minutes late. With Adler able to watch and listen to their every move from behind blast-proof doors, Neal and Peter open a door next to the hatch and find a code-breaking machine sitting on a ton of TNT.||||| With Neal's ankle monitor out of commission, Diana and Jones realize something is up. Especially when they figure out Peter disarmed it. After a timer counts down the an explosion, Alex tells Neal what to type in order to deactivate the explosives. They open the sub's primary hatch. Diana and Jones meet Sara and Mozzie (who has brought his machine) at the garden. Neal and Peter enter the sub. They finds billions of dollars' worth of Nazi plunder. At this point, Neal rips off his video glasses, cutting off contact with Adler. They find something which looks like Mozzie's fractal and rip it off the wall. Alder walks down and has his security take the three away. In the van Mozzie starts getting a moving signal. Adler's security dumps Neal, Peter and Alex in a dry dock slowly filling with water.

She gives him a new time and place to meet and leaves. At the Haskard's, Elizabeth photographs Glenn's documents he's prepared for the summit.||||| While tending to Erica, who is in pain, Erica makes Elizabeth start drawing. Philip calls Henry at St. Edward's while working late at the agency. Philip talks about losing Jeremy and Henry agrees with Stavos that Philip should have handled Jeremy. It says that sex is one of the techniques. Meeting with Rennhull for a third time with Paige and Marilyn again running counter-surveillance, he immediately pulls a gun on Elizabeth. Even after threatening that the KGB will kill him if he shoots, Rennhull says he's not going to betray his country nor face going to jail by being blackmailed. Begging for her life, Elizabeth kneels and is able to jump into Rennhull under his pistol's line of fire. They struggle, Elizabeth jumps on top of him and wrestles the gun under Rennhull's jaw. It goes off, killing Rennhull and splattering blood and brains all over Elizabeth's face. Hearing the shot, Paige breaks surveillance and runs out of her car.

Meanwhile, despite her injured legs, Lenalee tries to get out of Road's barrier by kicking it over and over again. She eventually becomes exhausted, but Chaozii, having seen her determination begins to punch the barrier in an attempt to break it down.

Road also expresses shock upon seeing the sword, which she remembers as one the Millennium Earl once held. Even Lenalee becomes concerned about the large amount of power coming from Allen. With this, Allen continues his fight with Tyki, asking him is there is anyone in the world he would want to protect. This makes Tyki think back to his human friends, especially Eeez , who he often gave gifts of small, precious stones and the silver buttons from the exorcist uniforms. Road reveals that she knows why he always takes the silver buttons from the slayed exorcists' uniforms and tells Tyki that he seems to be getting too friendly with the humans he hangs out with.||||| Despite thinking about the group of humans he cares for, Tyki maintains that there are times when the people he wants to protect do not matter - he greatly enjoys killing and destroying. At that moment, Allen strikes him with his Sword of Exorcism, and although Tyki felt the pain, he realises it did not kill him like he thought it would. Tyki is not completely unharmed, however, as it is revealed by Allen that he did not strike his body, but his Noah memories. When Allen prepares to deal the finishing blow to Tyki's Noah memories, Road leaps into action but Tyki stops her.

Joe sent for both of them. The brothers haven't spoken since Damon left Stefan on the train platform in WWII. Joe stabs Damon with a vervain needle, saying the money was too good to pass up. Damon manages to stab Joe in the neck with his broken glass before he drops. Another man comes in and says he'll be Damon's doctor from now on. In the present, Damon wakes up in a cell with Wes Maxfield injecting him with vervain. He tells Damon that because he killed his test subject last night (Jesse), Damon's going to take his place. Elena takes Aaron's help to find Damon At college, Elena drops in on Aaron, who is reeling over the death of his roommate, Jesse.||||| Even though Elena killed him, she pretends to be shocked. Aaron is overwhelmed by the fact that someone else close to him died. She asks about Wes, who became his legal guardian after his aunt Sarah died. She tells Aaron that Damon went to talk to Wes last night and no one has seen either of them since. She asks for his help finding Wes. Aaron thinks he knows a place. Elena asks Aaron if he thinks it's weird that both his friends committed suicide in their first semester. Elena tells Aaron that Wes covered up Megan's murder. Aaron wants to find Wes to ask him about it. He takes Elena to the Whitmore House, which she knows she can't enter. But Wes invites her in and she's able to enter. He confesses that he owns the house as part of the Whitmore Trust he inherited when his parents died. His name's Aaron Whitmore. Elena looks at a picture and recognizes her father. Wes joins them, and says Grayson Gilbert was one of the best doctors the Augustines ever had. Then he injects Elena with vervain.||||| Caroline makes Stefan go inside the safe to overcome his PTSD At the house, Stefan keeps watch over Katherine, trying to ensure she doesn't kill herself. She's pouty and angry about his hovering and thinks he can't help her until he deals with his own PTSD. She called in help. Caroline arrives as his sober coach--with a giant safe. Stefan questions whether the safe is a good idea for coping with his PTSD. Caroline reads up on PTSD while Stefan is in the safe. She's oblivious as Stefan starts to freak out inside. Outside, Katherine wonders how you help the guy who is always the hero for everyone else. She gets an idea.||||| Damon being experimented and tortured in 1953 by the Augustine society\n\nWes checks in on Damon in his cell. Damon remembers the last time he was locked up, by Dr. Whitmore. Flash back to 1953, Whitmore has Damon strapped to a table. He plans to experiment on him, knowing that as a vampire he'll heal from all his wounds. He plans to cut out parts of Damon's internal organs so he'll regrow them. To begin, he stabs Damon in the eye. Maxfield tells Damon that after training Jesse to crave vampire blood, he's ready to take his research to his next level. Aaron struggles to understand what Wes is doing. Wes tells him vampires exist and Elena is one of them. He opens his safe to reveal stacks of Whitmore files. Wes explains to Aaron that his father taught him everything he knows about vampires and research and the Whitmore Trust has been funding his research. He tells Aaron it's his legacy.||||| Wes captures Elena too\n\nElena wakes up in a cell next to Damon. Damon confesses he's been there before and tells her about Whitmore's torture, including cutting up pieces of them every day. He was there for about five years. He made a friend, Enzo, a soldier in Europe during WWII, who was also a vampire. Whitmore was working in a battlefield hospital overseas when he discovered Enzo was a vampire and locked him in a coffin and shipped him overseas. He'd been locked up ten years. Enzo tried to teach Damon how to survive, including picturing exactly how he'd get his revenge. Elena tells Damon that her dad worked with Whitmore and was an Augustine. She doesn't want to believe he'd be part of a place that would cut Damon's eyes out. Damon tells Elena about his friend Enzo who was also tortured along with him\n\n1953 Enzo keeps Damon going by talking to him about a girl named Maggie that he liked.||||| Whitmore interrupts, asking who's next. He goes for Damon, but Enzo volunteers. Damon listens to him scream from in his cell until he's finally brought back in a bloody heap. Damon asks Whitmore why he's doing this and he explains he's trying to understand vampires on a cellular level to make use of them. Back in the present, Elena thinks Stefan will figure it out and come rescue them, but Damon never told him he was locked up--he didn't want to give him more to feel guilty about. Damon explains how he escaped.||||| They let the vampires out once a year for the Augustine's New Year's Eve party to show them off. They were weak from vervain and captivity. Whitmore demonstrates vampire blood's healing powers, using Mrs. Fell as a volunteer. She drinks vampire blood to heal her hand after he cuts it. Enzo comes up with a plan, suggesting one of them drink both of their daily rations of blood for a year so that when they're let out next New Year's Eve, one of them will have the strength to fight. They play rock paper scissors and Damon wins. Elena wants to know what happened, but Damon is not forthcoming with the details, saying only that it wasn't pretty.||||| Aaron learns that his family was killed by a vampire\n\nWes gives Aaron his grandfather's watch, which he says is a precaution against vampires. Aaron sees news clips about his parents' death at a campground. Wes admits they were killed by vampires. Aaron decks Wes, knocking him to the ground.

In 1958, he'd been drinking Enzo's rations for a year and he'd gotten stronger. When Whitmore opened the cage to take Damon out to show him off to the guests on New Year's, Damon broke his own hand to slip out of the chains. He gouged Whitmore's eyes out, then attacked as many people as he could in the room, knocking over a candelabra as he went. The fire raged with Enzo still in the cage. Damon tried to free him, but the bars were coated in vervain and the fire was advancing. Finally, he chose to save himself, but he turned off his emotions first so he could leave Enzo behind. He left Enzo there to die in the fire.||||| Caroline hugs Stefan after he is successful in dealing with his PTSD\n\nBack at the house, in the safe Stefan hyperventilates, saying he feels like he's dying. Katherine tells Stefan she believes there is something to the doppelganger prophecy and Stefan wants to get far away from Damon and Elena and she's just the latest excuse to stay in town. Stefan starts choking her. She tells him she thinks he's choosing to focus on the physical pain of drowning in the safe instead of the emotional pain of Elena breaking his heart. She turns to offer Stefan her neck and urges him to fight it. She promises she's there with him.||||| They are dangerously close to kissing when Caroline opens the safe, worried about how quiet it got. Out of the safe, Stefan seems to look at Katherine differently. Aaron shoots Damon after he confesses that he was the one who killed Aaron's family\n\nAaron comes down to the cells in the basement with his gun. He accuses Elena of killing Megan and possibly of killing his parents. Damon stops him, and says it was him. Damon explains that with Enzo dead, he had to carry out his revenge plan himself. He planned to kill all the Whitmores in a generation, except one, then let him grow up and start a family, and then kill all of them except one, and so on. And he did.||||| Elena is disgusted and asks when the last one was. A few months ago, Sarah in Charleston. It was a weekend trip. Elena realizes they were together then. Aaron shoots Damon. Stefan and Katherine kiss\n\nBack at the house, Stefan tells Katherine he was right. He admits she knew what she was doing, and she admits sometimes she doesn't even know. She slides up close to him and runs her hands across his chest. She kisses him. He kisses her back. Caroline leaves Elena a message, saying she's going to stay at her mom's. She hears Stefan and Katherine making out and tells her to call. Elena meets Enzo and is shocked to find him alive\n\nBack in his dorm room, Aaron calls Wes, angry about having been lied to his whole life. Wes tells him to live his life.

{"Prompt": "Suppose you are a story-reteller, generate a list of main concepts to help me understand the story.\n\nStory: New York City A gunshot victim is brought into the ER. The paramedic pulls back the sheet to show it's Nina Sharp ( Blair Brown ). At FBI HQ in Boston Charlie ( Kirk Acevedo ), Broyles ( Lance Reddick ) and Olivia ( Anna Torv ) watch the security footage from Nina's building. There are three of them, wearing masks. They shoot her in the elevator then the tape cuts out for four minutes. They try to match the voice. David Robert Jones ( Jared Harris ), the ZFT mastermind. He says \"take out the camera, we can do it here.\" Olivia wants to bring William Bell ( Leonard Nimoy ) in. Broyles gently chastises her for assuming he doesn't agree. He's on board. Nina Sharp is out of surgery. Peter ( Joshua Jackson ) comes in to the lab. Walter ( John Noble ) didn't come home last night. Peter calls someone about Walter. Astrid ( Jasika Nicole ) can't find him either. Peter tells Olivia he understands why she had to say what she did. He's not worried about him.||||| Walter visits a grave, The Observer ( Michael Cerveris ) watches. Nina wakes up. Her electronic hand is on the fritz. Broyles is at her bedside. He asks her what Jones wanted with her arm. Nina asks for Olivia. Jones walks down a street carrying a briefcase, face partially bandaged. Olivia comes to Nina's room where specialists from Massive Dynamic are working on her. Jones and his crew start setting something up in the middle of a busy street. Nina tells Olivia that Jones worked for Bell 15 years ago but Bell isn't a terrorist. She says Jones was fired and was bitter about it since William was a father figure to him. She said after Jones busted out of prison he started calling for Bell a lot. Broyles tells Olivia that Nina thinks Jones wants to kill Bell. But she doesn't know where he is. She hasn't seen Bell for months. She thinks speaking to Bell has become more than a professional matter. She's counting on it. If Olivia can get to Jones first, she can talk to Bell.||||| Olivia asks what Jones did to Nina in the elevator after she was shot. Holding her bionic arm, she says Jones stole a very powerful energy cell Bell hid there. Jones delicately takes a small object out of a case and fits it into his machine. Through his bandages his face is bubbly and gross. The machine starts emitting a high pitched whine. People on the street start holding their ears. They increase the frequency. As Jones turns some knobs a whirring energy field appears in the street, like some sort of wormhole. Jones' men tell him they can't hold it open and it shuts, cutting off the back half of a truck that passed through. Jones says they're the wrong coordinates and they need to try again. When he removes his sunglasses we can see one of his eyes is now blue. Walter and The Observer walk along a beach. The Observer asks Walter if he recognizes a coin he's holding. Walter asks him how he got it. He says it looks similar to one Walter is thinking of, but it's different. \"There's more than one of everything,\" he says.||||| He asks him if the house they're in front of looks familiar and if he remembers what he has to find. He says there isn't much time. At Harvard, Broyles brings Nina into the lab. They ask her if Walter talked to anyone strange lately. Nina tells Peter that Jones has something Walter might know about. Nina calls someone for a search of Walter. Olivia and Charlie check out the half truck. Witnesses describe a curtain or window with a sheen that the truck came through. They describe a man in bandages. Nina shows Peter train security footage of his dad near a beach house they used to own. Peter wants to go up there himself. At the truck, Charlie gets a report the VIN and serial numbers don't exist and there's no record of it anywhere. Peter reaches the beach house. He looks around inside and finds Walter sitting by himself. He says he's looking for something. He's turning the coin over and over. He knows what he's looking for is important, but he can't remember what it is.||||| Olivia asks Nina where the truck came from. She asks where Bell is. She tells Nina to stop playing games or she'll turn this world over looking for him. Nina says that's the problem, he's not in this world. Providence, Rhode Island A black van pulls up to a kid's soccer game. Jones gets out. OIivia tries to talk Charlie through the idea Bell is in an alternate reality. That's why they can't ID the truck. It came from the other side. That's what Jones is using the energy cell for, to cross over to get to Bell. Their cell phones all ring. Walter searches frantically through the house, on the verge of a breakdown. Peter tries to calm him down, but he rails and thrashes and keeps searching. Peter tells his dad about fond memories of coming to the house as a kid, including Walter making pancakes. Walter gets excited when he remembers. He knows why he's there and where it is.||||| At the soccer field a kid describes a see-through wall that appeared, like a window. A kid ran into the shimmer and collapsed. They look at the body - it's cleanly sliced off. Charlie is ready to start buying the alternate reality theory. Olivia asks someone to run a check for all files mentioning science, biology or unexplained phenomena. All of them. She starts marking them on a map of New England with pushpins. She tells Broyles she thinks she found a connection and they need to call Nina. Walter opens a trunk in the beach house attic. He finds the box he was looking for with a coin just like the one The Observer gave him on top. It's a small tackle box, but it's locked. Olivia goes over the dots with Nina and Broyles. She marks the spots where Jones used his device. The other locations radiate out from them.||||| Walter opens the box and takes out a small object. He says when he and William were young they took copious amounts of LSD and became convinced they could experience alternate realities and some kids could see these alternate realities naturally. They theorized the subjects might be able to travel to alternate worlds. Around this time, Walter says, he lost something very dear to him. He thought he could find it over there. Nina explains finding the right place to cross over is the key. Bell proposed our world has \"soft spots,\" areas where the speed of light and protons have begun to decay, like the Bermuda Triangle, where it is easier to cross over. Their meddling with the laws of nature has increased the soft spots. She thinks Jones is looking for those. Walter continues the explanation, saying opening the hole could let things from there cross over to here, which could be dangerous. He built a plug, a patch to close the hole. That's what the object is. And he knows where the hole is: Reiden Lake.||||| Nina and Olivia want to try to predict the next soft spot. They trace the oldest incidents back to Reiden Lake. Jones and his men arrive at Reiden Lake. He tells them to set up the gear. \"Come on, men, we're going to the other side,\" he says. Peter drives Walter to the lake. Walter says they have to hurry, but he doesn't know why. He mentions his friend who visited him. Peter realizes he's talking about The Observer, the man who attacked him in the woods. Walter says Peter probably doesn't remember, but when he was very sick as a kid he began collecting coins to calm himself. He gives Peter the one he's been holding and says it was the coin. Peter doesn't remember it. Suddenly, their doors are opened and men grab them out of the car. Olivia runs over and calls off her agents. They're all there to plug a hole in the universe.||||| They see a bright light in the distance and run for it. Jones has got the machine going. He stays focused on it as his side starts trading gunfire with FBI agents. Walter gives Peter the patch to close the hole as Olivia creeps closer to Jones and the slowly opening universe hole. The hole opens up and Jones walks towards it. She shoots him. He keeps going. She shoots him again. He walks on. Looking oozy and gross, he tells her the teleporter may be killing him, but in the meantime it's made him something special. Bullets pass through him. He walks toward the opening. Olivia runs after him and Peter, holding the patch, runs after her. As Jones steps into the hole, Peter aims the patch at it, emitting a light. The hole closes shut, shearing Jones in half. Back at HQ Broyles tells OIivia that Nina sends her gratitude, but they've been told to cease and desist their investigation into William Bell.||||| Astrid arrives at the lab. She and Peter find a note, addressed to him. He reads it: \"Stepping out for a bit, don't worry about me, son, I know where I'm going.\" Peter tells Astrid not to call the police. It's the first time Walter's left a note. Walter stands back at the grave he visited earlier. He leaves the coin on it. It says: \"Peter Bishop, 1978-1985.\" Walter cries. Olivia's phone rings. It's Nina Sharp, summoning her to a hotel in Manhattan, planning to hold up her end of the bargain.||||| On her way there, through the city, Olivia is nearly hit by a speeding car. She makes it to the hotel as planned. She waits. She calls for Nina and is told Nina is out of the country. Olivia leaves. She rides the elevator down. She's alone. Then the lights flash and she's not, then she is again. The doors open on an all-white hallway. A woman greets her by name and shows her to an office. There is an oxygen tank and newspapers announcing Obama's victory. A man enters. \"I've been waiting quite a long time for this,\" he tells her. She asks where she is and who he is. The first part is complicated. The second is easy: He's William Bell. Olivia looks out the window. She's standing in one of the towers of the World Trade Center.\n\n \n", "original_narrative": "New York City A gunshot victim is brought into the ER. The paramedic pulls back the sheet to show it's Nina Sharp ( Blair Brown ). At FBI HQ in Boston Charlie ( Kirk Acevedo ), Broyles ( Lance Reddick ) and Olivia ( Anna Torv ) watch the security footage from Nina's building. There are three of them, wearing masks. They shoot her in the elevator then the tape cuts out for four minutes. They try to match the voice. David Robert Jones ( Jared Harris ), the ZFT mastermind. He says \"take out the camera, we can do it here.\" Olivia wants to bring William Bell ( Leonard Nimoy ) in. Broyles gently chastises her for assuming he doesn't agree. He's on board. Nina Sharp is out of surgery. Peter ( Joshua Jackson ) comes in to the lab. Walter ( John Noble ) didn't come home last night. Peter calls someone about Walter. Astrid ( Jasika Nicole ) can't find him either. Peter tells Olivia he understands why she had to say what she did. He's not worried about him.||||| Walter visits a grave, The Observer ( Michael Cerveris ) watches. Nina wakes up. Her electronic hand is on the fritz. Broyles is at her bedside. He asks her what Jones wanted with her arm. Nina asks for Olivia. Jones walks down a street carrying a briefcase, face partially bandaged. Olivia comes to Nina's room where specialists from Massive Dynamic are working on her. Jones and his crew start setting something up in the middle of a busy street. Nina tells Olivia that Jones worked for Bell 15 years ago but Bell isn't a terrorist. She says Jones was fired and was bitter about it since William was a father figure to him. She said after Jones busted out of prison he started calling for Bell a lot. Broyles tells Olivia that Nina thinks Jones wants to kill Bell. But she doesn't know where he is. She hasn't seen Bell for months. She thinks speaking to Bell has become more than a professional matter. She's counting on it. If Olivia can get to Jones first, she can talk to Bell.||||| Olivia asks what Jones did to Nina in the elevator after she was shot. Holding her bionic arm, she says Jones stole a very powerful energy cell Bell hid there. Jones delicately takes a small object out of a case and fits it into his machine. Through his bandages his face is bubbly and gross. The machine starts emitting a high pitched whine. People on the street start holding their ears. They increase the frequency. As Jones turns some knobs a whirring energy field appears in the street, like some sort of wormhole. Jones' men tell him they can't hold it open and it shuts, cutting off the back half of a truck that passed through. Jones says they're the wrong coordinates and they need to try again. When he removes his sunglasses we can see one of his eyes is now blue. Walter and The Observer walk along a beach. The Observer asks Walter if he recognizes a coin he's holding. Walter asks him how he got it. He says it looks similar to one Walter is thinking of, but it's different. \"There's more than one of everything,\" he says.||||| He asks him if the house they're in front of looks familiar and if he remembers what he has to find. He says there isn't much time. At Harvard, Broyles brings Nina into the lab. They ask her if Walter talked to anyone strange lately. Nina tells Peter that Jones has something Walter might know about. Nina calls someone for a search of Walter. Olivia and Charlie check out the half truck. Witnesses describe a curtain or window with a sheen that the truck came through. They describe a man in bandages. Nina shows Peter train security footage of his dad near a beach house they used to own. Peter wants to go up there himself. At the truck, Charlie gets a report the VIN and serial numbers don't exist and there's no record of it anywhere. Peter reaches the beach house. He looks around inside and finds Walter sitting by himself. He says he's looking for something. He's turning the coin over and over. He knows what he's looking for is important, but he can't remember what it is.||||| Olivia asks Nina where the truck came from. She asks where Bell is. She tells Nina to stop playing games or she'll turn this world over looking for him. Nina says that's the problem, he's not in this world. Providence, Rhode Island A black van pulls up to a kid's soccer game. Jones gets out. OIivia tries to talk Charlie through the idea Bell is in an alternate reality. That's why they can't ID the truck. It came from the other side. That's what Jones is using the energy cell for, to cross over to get to Bell. Their cell phones all ring. Walter searches frantically through the house, on the verge of a breakdown. Peter tries to calm him down, but he rails and thrashes and keeps searching. Peter tells his dad about fond memories of coming to the house as a kid, including Walter making pancakes. Walter gets excited when he remembers. He knows why he's there and where it is.||||| At the soccer field a kid describes a see-through wall that appeared, like a window. A kid ran into the shimmer and collapsed. They look at the body - it's cleanly sliced off. Charlie is ready to start buying the alternate reality theory. Olivia asks someone to run a check for all files mentioning science, biology or unexplained phenomena. All of them. She starts marking them on a map of New England with pushpins. She tells Broyles she thinks she found a connection and they need to call Nina. Walter opens a trunk in the beach house attic. He finds the box he was looking for with a coin just like the one The Observer gave him on top. It's a small tackle box, but it's locked. Olivia goes over the dots with Nina and Broyles. She marks the spots where Jones used his device. The other locations radiate out from them.||||| Walter opens the box and takes out a small object. He says when he and William were young they took copious amounts of LSD and became convinced they could experience alternate realities and some kids could see these alternate realities naturally. They theorized the subjects might be able to travel to alternate worlds. Around this time, Walter says, he lost something very dear to him. He thought he could find it over there. Nina explains finding the right place to cross over is the key. Bell proposed our world has \"soft spots,\" areas where the speed of light and protons have begun to decay, like the Bermuda Triangle, where it is easier to cross over. Their meddling with the laws of nature has increased the soft spots. She thinks Jones is looking for those. Walter continues the explanation, saying opening the hole could let things from there cross over to here, which could be dangerous. He built a plug, a patch to close the hole. That's what the object is. And he knows where the hole is: Reiden Lake.||||| Nina and Olivia want to try to predict the next soft spot. They trace the oldest incidents back to Reiden Lake. Jones and his men arrive at Reiden Lake. He tells them to set up the gear. \"Come on, men, we're going to the other side,\" he says. Peter drives Walter to the lake. Walter says they have to hurry, but he doesn't know why. He mentions his friend who visited him. Peter realizes he's talking about The Observer, the man who attacked him in the woods. Walter says Peter probably doesn't remember, but when he was very sick as a kid he began collecting coins to calm himself. He gives Peter the one he's been holding and says it was the coin.

Dreg promises that this spell will allow Glory to find the Key. She just needs some supplies, and she finds the advertisement for The Magic Box in the new phone book. Riley finds the front door to Buffy's house open, a blanket on the steps, and Spike in Buffy's room, sniffing her clothes. Spike declares that Buffy wouldn't care that he was in her room, and that the clothes-sniffing was just normal predator activity.

Howard tells them that he does not want to go, as the other guys, thinking that he was joking, laugh it off. The gang is gathering in front of the television in Leonard and Sheldon's apartment , getting ready to tune into Howard's launch. Amy is more fascinated by Sheldon 's recitation of the ingredients of the Pringles can, due to his eidetic memory.

In the flashback, Howard gives Bernadette a necklace with a star on it which he plans to take into outer space with him as a gift that no one else could give to her, since she will have a star that actually have been in space.

{"Prompt": "Suppose you are a story-reteller, generate a list of main concepts to help me understand the story.\n\nStory: Arya practices her swordplay while real swordplay spills out of the throne room after Cersei and Joffrey tried to claim the throne. The fighting heads into the courtyard, where Cersei's men kill anyone who gets in their way. Sansa goes looking for her sister, but her nursemaid hears the fighting and sends Sansa to her room with strict instructions not to open the doors for anyone. The nursemaid confronts four armed men alone. Arya loses at her practicing when her teacher Syrio Forel says one direction and she listens and follows instead of reacting to what he's actually doing. He lectures her on following what she sees and reacting. Lannister men come for Arya, but Forel confronts them. Armed with only a wooden sword he takes on four men. She watches, amazed as he disarms all the men until the captain is left. Arya urges him to leave with her, but he refuses to back down.||||| The captain fights him and breaks the Forel's wooden sword. He sends Arya away, asking what they say to the god of death. \"Not today,\" she parrots. She leaves. She runs and hears screams as they fight. Sansa runs into the Hound in the hallway. She threatens to tell the queen. \"Who do you think sent me?\" he taunts. Arya runs into the courtyard and sees the box that holds her sword Needle. She looks for it when a boy comes up and threatens her.||||| She tells him to get away and whirls with her sword in her hand. She stabs him through the gut and runs. Varys pays Ned Stark a visit down in his dungeon cell. He tells him Arya escaped, but Sansa remains engaged to Joffrey. Varys tells Ned the rest of his household is all dead. Varys asks why he told Cersei he knew the truth. Ned claims it was mercy. Varys says Ned got Robert killed and tells him he's a dead man. Ned thinks he's safe because Catelyn has Tyrion, but Varys tells him Tyrion is free. Ned wants Varys to just kill him now, but he declines. On leaving, Varys claims to serve the realm, because no one else does.||||| Jon Snow and his men bring two dead men back from beyond the wall. Sam notices they're frozen solid and don't smell. The Lord Commander Mormont is notified of a raven from King's Landing. Jon joins him in his chambers and Mormont asks for ale for them both. He tells Snow of Robert's death and that Stark has been charged with treason for conspiring with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Joffrey. Sansa listens to Cersei, Master Pycelle, Varys and Petyr. Cersei says she can't marry Joffrey now because she's a traitor. Petyr argues she should have a chance to prove her loyalty. Cersei tells her to write to her mother and Robb, telling him to come to King's Landing and swear loyalty to Joffrey. She asks what will happen to her father. Cersei tells her that depends on her brother, and on her. Robb reads the letter, but Maester Luwin can tell Cersei told Sansa what to say. Robb knows he cannot ignore the official command, so he'll go -- but not alone. He tells Luwin to summon the banner men to defend his father. Hundreds of ravens fly from Winterfell.||||| At the Vale, Catelyn is incensed that her sister Lysa waited all day to show her the word from the raven. She wants Lysa to send men to fight for Ned, but Lysa worries about the safety of her son, Robin. She says the knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale to protect their lord. Tyrion and Bronn walk home. Bronn admits he's in it for the money. Tyrion says that's not a problem, he'll always pay more than the other guy. In the middle of the night, Bronn wakes up hearing noises. They are quickly surrounded by Stonecrows and their leader, Shagga, son of Dolf. Tyrion brags about his family's money while bashing their crappy weapons. Tyrion takes off his ring and hands it over. He tells him if they help him, he'll help the Stonecrows take over the Vale. Jon Snow works in the Wall kitchen, when his tormentor comes in and taunts him about being the bastard son of a traitor. Jon lunges at him with a knife, but men stop him. The Lord Commander comes in later and confines Jon to his quarters.||||| Later at night, Jon's direwolf Ghost won't stop barking. Jon lets him out and follows him to the commander's room. Instead of Mormont, a giant disfigured bald man comes at him. He stabs him, but the man keeps coming. The man falls and the Commander comes out of his room and sees. The man gets up and starts to attack again so Jon throws his lit lantern at him and hustles Mormont out. Daenerys walks through a burnt down village with Jorah as the Dothraki attack the inhabitants. He explains that the Dothraki are pillaging to raise money for ships to sail to Westeros, as she wants. Everywhere, women and children are screaming as the Dothraki attack them, claiming the spoils of their victory.||||| Daenerys commands them to stop attacking one woman. She claims others, even though Jorah tells her they belong to the warriors. Daenerys returns to camp to find her husband sitting next to a pile of severed heads. Mago , a warrior, is complaining to Khal that Daenerys took the women he was planning to \"mount.\" Daenerys makes a polite case for preventing the women from being raped, saying it is her will and as Khalessi he has to listen to her. Khal Drago enjoys seeing his fierce bride, but Mago says a khal who takes orders from a \"foreign whore\" isn't really a khal. He draws his sword. Drogo walks into it purposefully and presses his chest against it as he tells Mago what he'll do to his corpse. Without drawing his own weapon, Drogo ducks and darts to avoid Mago, then finally kills him with his own sword and rips out his tongue with his bare hands.||||| One of Daenerys's new slaves offers to help clean Drogo's cut. The Dothraki are suspicious, but Daenerys asks her husband to let the woman treat him. He relents. At Winterfell, Robb deals with the ego of the Greatjon, who demands he get to lead the vanguard into King's Landing, saying Robb is too green. He threatens to take his men and go home if not. Robb stares him down and says he's welcome to leave, but after he takes care of the Lannisters he'll come for him for breaking his oath to his father. Greatjon draws his sword and Robb's direwolf races at him and rips off a few fingers. Robb uses it as an excuse to show he knows enough to let a wolf deal with things for him. Cowed, the Greatjon laughs off the missing digits and the situation is diffused. Robb says good-bye to Bran in the middle of the night and tells him to stay at Winterfell. After he leaves, their younger brother Rickon comes in, worried about their parents.||||| The next day, Bran prays to the Old Gods. Osha, the captured wildling woman, tells him the gods heard him, but she predicts bad things for Robb headed south and tells Bran the true threat lies to the north. Sam, Jon Snow and the troops stand around the burning bodies of the men they found beyond the wall. Sam thinks they were touched by White Walkers. He read about them. He says they sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years. He hopes the wall is high enough to keep them out. Catelyn comes upon an encampment. Robb reports that the River Lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister on their heels, and Lord Tywin is bringing a larger army from the south. Catelyn walks in. She asks to talk to Robb alone, then hugs him. He shows her Sansa's letter. They notice there's no mention of Arya. Robb tells her he has 18,000 men.||||| Catelyn says their only hope is that he can defeat the Lannister army in the field. She reminds him what happened to the Targaryen children when they lost throne: they were butchered in their sleep, on the orders of Tywin Lannister. She tells him if he loses, the Starks all die. \"Well that makes it simple, then,\" he says. Tyrion and Bronn march with the Stonecrows. They reach Tywin Lannister's camp. Tyrion leads them in and makes introductions. Tyrion learns the Robert is dead and Cersei is essentially in charge of King's Landing. They know Robb called in his banners and is leading an army. Tyrion asks for the armor, swords and pikes to pay his debts. He's interrupted by an update from the field. Tywin announces he's moving against Robb Stark. He asks Shagga and his men to fight with him and promises them more loot. Shagga says only if Tyrion rides with them.||||| Robb tries to figure out his next move. They need to cross the river at the Twins, which Lord Frey controls. He's bannerman to Catelyn's father, but isn't exactly reliable. Robb's men bring in a Lannister spy they caught. They say he was counting the men. Robb asks how high he got. When the man says 20,000, Robb talks about mercy and commands his men to let him go. Robb tells the spy to tell Lord Tywin that \"winter is coming\" with 20,000 men. As soon as the spy leaves, the men wonder about his move. Ned is roused from his cell.||||| Sansa comes to court to hear Cersei force retirement on Ser Barristan from the King's Guard, which is supposed to be til death. \"You let my father die, you're too old to protect anyone,\" Joffrey snipes. Cersei announces Jaime will take over as lord commander of the King's Guard. Varys promises Barristan a good house, but Barristan is indignant. He draws his sword and tosses it on the floor, telling Joffrey to melt it and add it to the others in the throne. There's an announcement calling for any other business. Sansa steps forward. She begs mercy for her father. She reminds them that he never wanted to be hand and loved the king. She says Pycelle gave him milk of the poppy and he wasn't himself when he said Joffrey wasn't king. She begs Joffrey personally. Joffrey says Ned has to confess and say that he is the king or there will be no mercy. \"He will,\" she says.\n\n \n", "original_narrative": "Arya practices her swordplay while real swordplay spills out of the throne room after Cersei and Joffrey tried to claim the throne.

Dowd is an endlessly pleasant and delightfully eccentric bachelor living in a small town that isn't quite aware that its newest citizen is a invisible, 6'3\" white rabbit named \"Harvey,\" that only certain people can see. After supposedly meeting this rabbit - its origins attributed to the Celtic legend of the Pooka - Dowd's sanity is put into question by his equally eccentric sister, Veta Louise. Elwood casually drives his sister's guests from their house by introducing and carrying on one-sided conversations with his invisible and silent friend. His sister and niece, Myrtle Mae, resort to taking him to the local sanitarium to have him committed. However, owing to people not paying attention, interrupting, and cutting Elwood off as he is about to introduce his imaginary friend, it doesn't immediately appear that there is anything wrong with him, although the examining doctor is sure he is doing the right thing by admitting him.||||| Elwood is carted upstairs by a rough-handed and simple-minded man in the white coat while the examining doctor ushers the sister into the head psychiatrist's --Dr. Chumley's-- office to give a description of the problem. As Elwood is \"escorted\" to hydrotherapy, he tells the man in the white coat his friend \"Harvey\" is a \"Pooka\"||||| The Aide later looks up the definition in the dictionary: \"Celtic mythology, a mischievous spirit that takes animal form and appears sometimes to some people for the purpose of doing this and that.\" As Veta, still highly upset over Elwood driving away her friends, bemoans Elwoods delusions to Dr. Chumley, her frazzled manner and insistence that Elwood actually does have a six foot 3 inch invisible rabbit for a friend convinces Chumley it is she, not Elwood, who is hallucinating. He quickly has Veta carted upstairs and, fearing a lawsuit for incarcerating and treating a sane man, brings Elwood down and makes every manner of friendly gesture, including firing the examining doctor, Dr. Sanderson . His nurse, Miss Kelly, who is actually quite fond of Dr. Sanderson, is crestfallen, but, upset at being fired, the good doctor is unaware of her feelings for him, and this angers her.||||| Elwood in his normal good natured way takes no exception to any of the events and once again, as he is about to introduce \"Harvey,\" gets cut off, interrupted and ignored while Dr. Chumley pursues his patronizing commentary. Never one to interrupt, the pinnacle of politeness, Elwood lets him say whatever he is going to say and is finally given a pass to leave. Soon Veta's friends, including Judge Gaffney, and Myrtle Mae arrive. The mistake is uncovered, and the entire group goes into a panic trying to find Elwood. Veta and the Judge Gaffney promise to sue the sanitarium for wrongful incarceration and rough treatment. Distraught, Elwood drinks heavily and retires to his favorite watering hole, Charlie's. Dr. Chumley, himself, tracks Elwood down, but while he is doing this, everyone else is looking in other places. When it finally becomes apparent to everyone that the Doctor has been gone for over four hours and that Elwood is not back in custody, another major panic ensues and the group descends on Charlie's to see what has happened to Dr. Chumley.||||| Elwood, of course, is sitting alone, drinking, and maintains that the doctor left the bar with Harvey. They are convinced he is a madman and has done away with the doctor. However, in his easygoing and pleasant manner, Elwood sidetracks everyone with drinks and conversation and disarms them. Eventually the subject does turn back to the missing doctor, and the panic ensues again. The police are summoned, the heavy handed man in the white coat muscles Elwood back to the sanitarium, but not before becoming infatuated with Myrtle Mae and making advances toward her.||||| Although he is a big galoot, she's attracted to him. The entire entourage, of Veta, Myrtle Mae, Dr. Sanderson, Miss Kelly, Judge Gaffney, the guard and the police, arrive at the sanitarium in a police car and a taxi to discover the doctor is there. However, Dr. Chumley arrives back at the hospital with a look of admiration and fear. Dr. Chumley indeed did leave with Harvey, the Pooka, but he wisely does not say anything about it to anyone, dismisses them all and tells everyone that everything is under control. He tells Dr. Sanderson that he is a fine doctor and can have his job back, then disappears into his office. Sanderson then decides to administer a very powerful injection, called Formula 977, into Elwood that will make him cease with his delusions about the rabbit for once and for all.||||| Meanwhile the cab driver wants his money for the fare. No one seems to have any money so Veta says she'll pay. Digging everything out of her handbag, she discovers her money is gone. She assures the driver that if he waits until Elwood has his injection, she'll pay him handsomely when they are driven back home. The Cab driver however has dour insights into the effects of the injection about to be administered to Elwood. He says he's given many people a ride to the sanitarium for that injection and it changes them into crabby mean people; normal but irritable and unpleasant.||||| Elwood, the most disarming and engaging and mild mannered man in the universe, is on the verge of being turned permanently into a real nuisance, so Veta abruptly changes her mind and rushes in and prevents the injection. Dr. Chumley asks to see Elwood privately in his office where Elwood tells him tells the incredible story of how he came to meet Harvey, and explains the way in which people react when they meet them. Elwood also explains that Harvey has the power to stop time by saying:\n\n\"Did I tell you he could stop clocks? Well, you've heard the expression 'His face would stop a clock'? Well, Harvey can look at your clock and stop it. And you can go anywhere you like, with anyone you like, and stay as long as you like. And when you get back, not one minute will have ticked by. You see, science has overcome time and space. Well, Harvey has overcome not only time and space, but any objections.\"||||| By this point, Dr. Chumley is not only convinced of Harvey's existence, but has begun spending time with him on his own, and requests that Elwood allow Harvey to stay with him for a while and help him out by making his long-needed sabbatical a reality. Apparently this is one of the things Harvey can do if he is so inclined. Elwood asks Harvey if he will work with Chumley and tells Chumley that Harvey agrees. Dr. Sanderson pays for the cab and warms up to the nurse who has a crush on him. The entourage leaves, with the heavy-handed guard and Myrtle Mae making a date to see each other. As the sister digs in her pocketbook she discovers her money purse. She looks over her shoulder and says knowingly, \"Harvey,\" and shakes her head.||||| She knew Harvey existed, and was mischievous, and her only reason for wanting to have Elwood committed was that Elwood's insistence on introducing him to her guests was driving everyone away. As Elwood is leaving, Dr. Chumley asks Elwood for Harvey's help, and Elwood, being the obliging fellow he is, makes no objection. Dr. Chumley, arm in arm with an invisible companion, asks \"Have you ever been to Akron?\" In the final shot, after the gates to Chumley's Residence are closed, and Elwood is leaving, he stops, turns around and has a conversation with an invisible Harvey, who is already back from his trip to Akron (only a few minutes have gone by, but it was weeks due to Harvey the Pooka stopping time) and reaffirms their friendship. Harvey opens the security gate (showing only the control handles moving by themselves; Harvey is never seen on camera), and Elwood and his invisible companion saunter off towards the bus stop, following Veta and Myrtle Mae, towards the planned last stop of Charlie's Bar and another drink.\n\n \n", "original_narrative": "Elwood P.

An irate Rodney complains to his older brother that he once had a golden opportunity to make money by becoming a window cleaner, but Del forced Rodney to give it up because of family ties. Del then tells Rodney that he will become the owner of Trotters Independent Traders, which involves trading nothing but 24 computers that don't work, and a Persian rug that is covered in food.||||| Rodney is still not happy with this idea, and lashes out at Del about how he raised him as his apprentice when their mother Joan died and their father Reg ran away. Del tries to calm Rodney down by saying that he'll send him money from the cars he and Jumbo sell, yet Rodney believes that the real opportunity to make money lies in Britain, because people who want a good bargain turn to traders like the Trotter brothers. Del then sternly says that he still wants to go to Australia, and that's final. Angered by Del's words, Rodney storms out of the flat in tears. A disgusted Albert returns from the kitchen, and he says that he heard every word his nephews said to each other. That evening, as Albert finishes watching TV, and Rodney is still out, Del is still making his choice of either staying in Peckham or going to Australia.||||| Albert suggests that Del should take the opportunity to go to Australia and become a millionaire while he has the chance, which means Rodney will have to learn to grow up. With his mind made up, Del calls Jumbo on the telephone, and tells him that he won't be coming over to Australia, because Del reluctantly admits that he cannot leave his family behind, much to Albert's delight. Jumbo understands, cancels the deal, and he and Del say goodbye to each other.||||| After hanging up, Del tells Albert that he cannot leave him or Rodney because of very strong family ties. As Albert heads off to bed, an apologetic Rodney returns home to tell Del that he owes him an apology for what he said earlier, and to tell his older brother that he needs to go to Australia and seize the opportunity. But Del tells his younger brother that he has already turned down the offer. The Trotter brothers then talk about how Rodney was right when he told Del that the real opportunity to become a millionaire lies in Britain, and this time next year, they'll be millionaires. The Trotter brothers make up, Rodney goes to bed happy, and Del secretly laments his lost opportunity for wealth by singing \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" before going to bed himself.", "row": 54, "response": "Here are the main concepts to help you understand the story:\n\n1. **Reunion**: The story begins with a reunion between Del Boy and his old school friend and business partner, Jumbo Mills, who has returned from Australia.\n2. **Business Opportunity**: Jumbo offers Del Boy a chance to renew their partnership and run his car business in Australia, which Del Boy is initially reluctant to accept.\n3. **Family Ties**: The story revolves around the strong family bonds between Del Boy, Rodney, and Uncle Albert, which ultimately influence Del Boy's decision.\n4. **Immigration Issues**: Rodney's criminal conviction prevents him from obtaining an immigration visa to Australia, causing tension between the brothers.\n5. **Conflict and Resolution**: The story explores the conflict between Del Boy's desire to pursue wealth in Australia and his loyalty to his family, ultimately leading to a resolution where Del Boy chooses to stay in Peckham with his family.\n6. **Character Development**: The story highlights Del Boy's character, showcasing his loyalty, sense of responsibility, and ultimate decision to prioritize family over personal gain.\n7. **Themes**: The story touches on themes such as family, loyalty, opportunity, and the importance of staying true to one's roots.\n\nThese concepts should provide a solid foundation for understanding the story and its characters!", "decomposed_mcs": ["The story begins with a reunion.", "The reunion is between Del Boy and his old school friend.", "The reunion is between Del Boy and his business partner.", "The business partner is Jumbo Mills.", "Jumbo Mills has returned from Australia.", "Business Opportunity Jumbo offers Del Boy a chance to renew their partnership.", "Business Opportunity Jumbo offers Del Boy a chance to run his car business in Australia.", "Del Boy is initially reluctant to accept.", "The story of Family Ties revolves around the strong family bonds.", "The strong family bonds are between Del Boy, Rodney, and Uncle Albert.", "The strong family bonds ultimately influence Del Boy's decision.", "Rodney has a criminal conviction.", "Rodney's criminal conviction prevents him from obtaining an immigration visa to Australia.", "There is tension between the brothers.", "The story explores the conflict between Del Boy's desire to pursue wealth in Australia and his loyalty to his family.", "The conflict ultimately leads to a resolution.", "The resolution is that Del Boy chooses to stay in Peckham with his family.", "The story highlights Del Boy's character.", "Del Boy's character showcases his loyalty.", "Del Boy's character showcases his sense of responsibility.", "Del Boy's character showcases his ultimate decision to prioritize family over personal gain.", "The story touches on the theme of family loyalty.", "The story touches on the theme of opportunity.", "The story touches on the theme of the importance of staying true to one's roots."]}
{"Prompt": "Suppose you are a story-reteller, generate a list of main concepts to help me understand the story.\n\nStory: Eren Jaeger stands momentarily speechless over the burned body of his childhood friend, Armin Arlelt . He realizes he should have known what would happen, but had no choice but to rely on him. Eren hears the weight of a Titan landing in the distance, and turns around in time to see the Cart Titan , carrying Zeke on its back. The Cart Titan gallops across the rooftops to reach Eren, who quickly moves to hold the unconscious Bertholdt Hoover hostage, placing his blade at the Warrior 's throat. As the Cart Titan stops, Eren gets a better look at Zeke and sees that he has marks around his face that shows he can turn into a Titan. He realizes that he is probably the Beast Titan . Zeke looks at Eren in shock and asks if he is Eren Jaeger. He says Eren looks nothing like his father and tells him that he knows what Eren is going through, as they are both victims of Grisha Jaeger. As Zeke tells Eren that he has been brainwashed by his father, Eren realizes that Zeke resembles Grisha.||||| However, Zeke looks up with consternation when he sees that Levi Ackermann has survived his battle with the remaining Titans and has climbed to the top of Wall Maria . Being in no shape to fight him again, Zeke calls their fight a draw and apologizes to the unconscious Bertholdt, saying that it is the end for him. The Cart Titan turns to leave and Zeke tells Eren that one day he will be coming back to rescue him. The Cart Titan gallops away with Zeke in tow.||||| Levi lands on the rooftop near Eren after using the last of his gas. He demands the rest of Eren's blades and gas so he can pursue Zeke. Eren begins to comply when he hears Armin gasp for breath. Elsewhere in Shiganshina District , Hange Zoe asks a conscious, but dismembered, Reiner Braun about a metal case that was in his chest pocket. He tells Hange that it is a letter written by Ymir , and that the Scouts need to deliver it to Christa . Hange agrees, but only after they inspect it. They would like to ask him more questions, but draws their blade, feeling that he is not inclined to talk. Reiner does not disagree.||||| However, when Hange begins to cut Reiner's throat, Jean Kirschtein asks them to wait, thinking they might be able to steal his power . Prior to beginning the operation, Erwin Smith had laid out guidelines for the use of the Scout Regiment 's one syringe of Titan injection , with the expectation that they could possibly take the Beast, Armored , or Colossal Titan 's powers. Not only could the Scouts gain valuable information regarding Titan powers, but they could also revive a single soldier on the brink of death. However, Hange does not feel that all the conditions have been met. Levi has the injection, but they do not know his status and they are uncertain they have the time to find out.||||| Even if Hange cuts off Reiner's head, they are not certain if that will actually kill him. Jean argues though, that this is not like Hange, and asks how they are supposed to beat the Titans if they back down because they lack the knowledge. Hange considers and asks Mikasa Ackermann to meet up with Eren and Armin to check out their situation, then to refill her gas and retrieve the injection from Levi. If she cannot, then she is to fire a signal flare as a signal to end Reiner. Mikasa agrees and flies off to find Levi.\n\nMikasa arrives to find Eren bent over Armin, desperately encouraging his friend to breathe. Eren hurriedly asks Levi for the syringe so they can have Armin eat Bertholdt. Levi, after a moment's hesitation, agrees and pulls out the case with the injection. Seeing this, Mikasa fires a signal flare as directed, but before Hange can kill Reiner, the Cart Titan gallops up behind them. Jean quickly fires his omni-directional mobility gear and pulls Hange out of the way before the Cart Titan can eat them.||||| Hange gets back up in time to see that the Cart Titan has picked up Reiner in its mouth, and it runs away with him and Zeke. Jean curses and blames himself for intervening when Hange was about to kill Reiner, but Hange reminds him that ultimately they made the call. Hange decides that they should regroup with the others. As Levi is about to hand Eren the Titan injection, Floch climbs up on the rooftop, carrying Erwin on his back. Erwin is severely wounded, but still alive, and Floch has been looking for Levi in hopes that the injection could save him. Seeing this, Levi takes back the injection and has Floch bring Erwin onto the roof. Levi inspects and confirms that Erwin is still breathing, then announces that Erwin will receive the injection. Eren is horrified, reminding Levi that he had already agreed to use it on Armin. Levi responds that he will revive the one who can save humanity. He hears a blade being drawn and turns to see that Mikasa has drawn her weapon, tears in her eyes.||||| On the Wall, Zeke surveys the wasteland of Shiganshina and notes that Reiner was incredibly lucky to have survived. Realizing what Eren and Mikasa intend, Levi asks them if they understand what they are doing. He reminds them that Erwin is their commander, and to stay out of his way. Eren grabs onto the serum in Levi's hand, and Levi orders him to keep his emotions in check. Eren then furiously asks why Levi did not use the serum on Armin right away. Levi admits that he was considering the possibility of Erwin still being alive, and now that Erwin is here, he will receive the injection. Eren tightens his grip on the Titan injection, and Levi, losing his patience, strikes Eren with his fist, knocking out several of his teeth and sending him flying. Outraged, Mikasa lunges at Levi and puts her blade to his throat. She realizes that Levi has been weakened from his previous battles, and she is certain that she can take the injection from him by force.||||| Both Levi and Floch appeal to her sense of reason and the need to save Erwin so they can use his talents to save humanity. Though Eren is barely able to speak, he counters that it would be no different if they lose Armin. Armin discovered Annie Leonhart 's identity as the Female Titan , he was the one who came up with the plan to save Trost and thought of moving soldiers at night, and it was thanks to Armin that they found Reiner and defeated Bertholdt. Eren believes that Armin will be the one who will save humanity, not Erwin or even Eren himself.||||| Mikasa renews her efforts to take the injection from Levi, but Floch stands up to her, saying that she is not the only one who has had it rough. Floch lets her know that all of the Scouts that were on the other side of the Wall are dead, killed by the Beast Titan's barrage. Erwin came up with a plan to fight back against the Beast Titan, and Floch's comrades were all slaughtered just as planned. When Floch found Erwin, he thought about killing him, but decided that would have been too easy. He wants Erwin to endure more of this hell, but then he looked to his left and saw Levi killing the Titans, and is reminded of the Titan injection. It takes a devil to fight the Titans, and Floch believes he was spared from dying so that he could bring Erwin back.||||| Floch tries to take the injection and Mikasa moves to intercept him, but Hange grabs her first and manages to pull her away before she can strike him. The rest of the squad has arrived now, and is able to see the choice that must be made. Levi gets up and opens the injection case, preparing to inject Erwin. Mikasa screams and Hange reminds her of how much they need Erwin and that they know what it is like to lose people.||||| Hange is only here now because Moblit Berner had died pushing them into a well to escape the Colossal Titan's transformation blast. Though there are countless people Hange wants to bring back, there comes a time to say farewell, and they have no choice but to keep moving forward. Hearing this, Mikasa finally relents and Levi prepares the injection. However, Eren weakly pulls at Levi's leg and asks him if he knows about the sea. Despite Floch's intervention, Eren tells Levi about Armin's dream to look at the sea, and admits that, though he was only ever driven by hatred of the Titans, Armin is not like him, and has dreams of his own. Levi glances at Armin's body and then gives the order for everyone to clear out so he can have Erwin eat Bertholdt. The group relocates, with Floch taking Eren away so he cannot intervene, and Levi is left alone.||||| Levi drags Bertholdt into position as he thinks about Erwin and Armin's respective dreams. He takes Erwin's arm and prepares to give him the injection when Erwin suddenly lifts it out of his grip and raises his hand, apparently believing himself to be back in his father's classroom. Delirious, Erwin asks his father how they can know for sure that there are no more humans outside the Walls. Levi regards him with surprise and remembers how he asked Erwin to give up on his dream, and how his uncle Kenny Ackermann had spoken about how people could only keep going if they were drunk on something. Remembering Erwin's gratitude to him, Levi makes his choice. Bertholdt wakes up in time to see a small blond Titan looming over him.||||| He begins to struggle and notices his former friends watching from several rooftops away. Bertholdt panics and cries out for help, but to no avail. As he screams for Annie and Reiner, Armin's Titan closes its jaws on his head and devours him. Floch asks Levi why he changed his mind as Levi and Hange sit beside Erwin's body. Levi explains that Erwin only became a devil because that was what was needed of him. He had been set free, but they were about to drag him back for more, and Levi decided it was time to let him rest. Levi apologizes to Erwin that he was not able to kill the Beast Titan like he promised, so he will have to wait. Hange inspects Erwin and lets Levi know that he has passed away. Behind them, the blond Titan collapses to the ground.

Black shows up and says he wants their help sending David a message and then proceeds to backhand Emily across the face We see Jack informing David that Black has been released and his flash drive is gone. Since Black thinks Kate is still alive David knows he won't leave town anytime soon. At the station Jack asks Hunter to help him find Black. It turns out Hunter is pretty well informed on the situation, including Emily's real identity. He uses Alvarez' disappearance to convince Hunter to help. David is texted a video from Black that features Emily and Victoria. He wants his daughter back the following day, unharmed. David fills in Jack and Hunter as to the latest with Black's demands. David doesn't think they should involve anyone else. Margot flashes back to a conversation with Victoria where she's confessed to hurting David in order to save Daniel.

Hunter and Jack track down Emily's car. They notice a security camera nearby and Jack has an idea. Victoria tries to trade her freedom for information that will lead Black to his daughter. She gives him Jack's name. Jack rushes to David and tells him he has a plan to track down the ladies. David doesn't think there's time and says he's going to take care of things on his own.

Emily tells Victoria about David's plan to kill her and stage a suicide. Louise updates Nolan about her mother's orders that if she goes public with the drugging she'll be cut off. She talks about her father, the only person that kept her sane all those years with her mother. Nolan starts brainstorming a way they can get her money away from Penelope.

Shaq and Dr. Phil have only two minutes to free themselves of their leg braces before dying from the room's airborne nerve gas. Finally, Shaq makes the basket and lowers the saws down. Dr. Phil ends up sawing off the wrong foot, thereby remaining chained and the two are presumed to be dead. Tom Logan (Charlie Sheen), spoofing Bill Pullman's character from The Grudge, wakes up.||||| There are three girls (from The Girls Next Door on E!) in his bed who later have a pillow fight. He tries to kill himself by taking too many sleeping pills but the pills turn out to be Viagra, resulting in him tumbling over a balustrade, landing on his erect penis, and dying. Cindy Campbell goes to get a new job (parodying Sarah Michelle Gellar's character in The Grudge). She's been asked to be a caretaker for the creepy \"Grudge House.\" She receives a tour inside, Cindy expects nothing and she gets a 'feeling of evil' as the guide tries to hide the overflowing hair on the ceiling, in drawers and baskets and on his head; and The Grudge Boy in the bathtub by pushing him down with a plunger, and then walks out naked and Cindy smiles and says \"I'll take it\".||||| Meanwhile, Cindy's neighbour Tom Ryan (Craig Bierko), spoofing Tom Cruise's character in War of the Worlds, gets fired from his job as a crane operator at the docks. At a bar afterwards he runs into Mahalik (Anthony Anderson) and CJ (Kevin Hart) where it is revealed, in a parody of Brokeback Mountain, that the two have started a homosexual relationship. Tom gets home, where his ex-wife (Molly Shannon) has just arrived with his children, Robbie and Rachel, who both resent him. Cindy's job is to look after the incapacitated Mrs. Norris (Cloris Leachman), however she is incompetent at it, to the point of accidentally sponge bathing Mrs. Norris with her own urine. Throughout the night Cindy notices strange events going on in the house, culminating in her finding a ghostly boy in the attic.||||| The next morning she confides in Tom about the events of the previous night, which leads to a conversation about their past relationships.||||| Cindy has a flashback to her first marriage, showing a big African-American man cussing her out, and then another to her second marriage, to the death of her husband George (Simon Rex) where, in a parody of Million Dollar Baby, George trips and breaks his neck (as do numerous members of the audience) during a boxing match between Cindy and Tiffany Stone, a female version of Mike Tyson also showing a pile of bitten-off ears. As they share a kiss, the sky suddenly goes stormy and everything electrical stops working (In the real movie cars stopped working, but in this movie cars, bicycles, skateboards and a man runs out of a toilet, trousers down and holding a newspaper (\"My bowels have stopped moving!\"). Tom goes to investigate, and discovers the world has come under attack by gigantic triPods (giant iPods) that play 80s music... and then switches to the \"Destroy Humanity\" playlist, transforming the iPods into actual Tripods, which vaporize the humans they zap (it was also showed three people which seemed to be rappers, get vaporized and dropping a huge pile of bling-blings).||||| Cindy runs back into her house and finds the ghost boy again.

Cindy runs into Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall), who apparently faked her death in Scary Movie 3, and together they manage to find the last working car and follow the directions of the ghost boy.||||| The scene then changes to the President of the United States being informed that aliens are attacking. President Baxter Harris (Leslie Nielsen) is sitting in Edna R. Penhall Elementary School, listening to a book being read (something about a duck); when his aide Jamison (Alonzo Bodden) comes, he sits motionless, wanting to hear the rest of the story.

Moments before their deaths, Cindy finds photos in the toilet of Jigsaw, a woman, and the ghost boy, and realizes that Jigsaw was the ghost boy's real father, and the entire invasion was revenge for his son's death. He then says \"Anyone can hold a grudge, but it takes real courage to forgive,\" and it is at this time that Jigsaw comes into the spotlight. He then tells them that the invasion is over and allows them to leave.||||| He apologizes for the invasion and killing millions of people, and then Brenda (who went through a rotating wall into the control room earlier) and Jigsaw's brother, Zoltar, emerge from the other room, where they have just had sex. Jigsaw asks Zoltar if he caught anything, Zoltar replies that Brenda (untruthfully) told him she was a virgin and Jigsaw finishes by saying \"We are so fucked.\"||||| Nine months later, Brenda gives birth to a baby that looks just like Jigsaw and Zoltar.

Despite Jerry's complaint of fever, James whisks him by helicopter to a remote giant sinkhole, where Jerry helps James and his assistants set up cones to catch falling butterflies as James pumps smoke into the trees. Several huge spiders also fall, and James captures two in jars, but a third spider slips into Jerry Manley's backpack. Back in camp, as James studies the spiders, he notes that, like solider ants, they have no reproductive organs. While Jerry rests in his tent, the third spider crawls from his backpack and delivers a fatal bite to his stomach. Thinking Jerry died of fever, James packs his body into a box to be shipped home, but the spider slips inside. When the body arrives in Canaima, California, mortician Irv Kendall is shocked at its desiccated condition, as if something sucked it dry. The spider sneaks out of the box and escapes through a cat door.||||| A crow swoops down and picks it up, but soon plummets lifelessly into the yard of a house where Dr. Ross Jennings, his wife Molly, and children Tommy and Shelley have just arrived from San Francisco, California. Dr. Jennings has chosen to take over as town physician when Dr. Samuel \"Sam\" Metcalf retires the following week. Tommy Jennings sees the large spider and reports it to his mother, who finds a smaller, harmless spider instead and releases it in the barn out back. The foreign spider joins the domestic spider, and the two mate. When Dr. Jennings visits Sam to discuss taking over his practice, the old physician has second thoughts about retiring. Jennings panics, because he has bought a house and rented an office in Canaima. Retired schoolteacher Margaret Hollins volunteers to be his first patient, and when he gives her a check-up, he discovers that Sam unnecessarily put Margaret on high blood pressure medication.||||| Meanwhile, Molly, an amateur photographer, takes pictures of a large web in the barn. Hoping to cure her husband of his fear of spiders, she takes him to see it, but Ross is terrified by his earliest childhood memory of a spider crawling on him. Just out of sight in the loft, an egg sac pulsates. Later, Margaret throws a lawn party to introduce Dr. Jennings to the townspeople, and Tommy and Shelley make friends with neighbor Bunny Beechwood, whose father, Henry Beechwood, is the high school coach. Other guests include Jerry Manley's parents, grieving over their son's death and angry they could not view his body before burial. That evening, a spider gets into Margaret's house and fatally bites her hand. The next day, Dr. Jennings attempts to convert his basement into a wine cellar, but the wood is rotten. When he fires a nail gun into the ceiling, the nails shoot through the floor boards above.||||| He goes to Margaret's to thank her for the party, and sees her body through a window. Sam Metcalf declares she had a heart attack and blames Ross for taking her off blood pressure pills. Recognizing signs of convulsion, Ross suggests an autopsy, but Sam refuses, because locals object to having their bodies desecrated. Margaret is buried without being examined. Meanwhile, Molly Jennings hires local exterminator Delbert McClintock to check the house for termites, but he finds only \"bad wood.\" Henry Beechwood asks Dr. Jennings to give his football players physical examinations. Later, during practice, a spider crawls into a football helmet. After player Todd Miller puts it on, he is bitten while being tackled and dies. His teammates surround him, take off the helmet, and lay it aside. Nobody sees the spider crawling out, but a player steps on it and kills the arachnid without noticing.||||| Though Todd's death is blamed on the tackle, some wonder if Dr. Jennings is to blame and call him \"Dr. Death.\" That night, Dr. Sam Metcalf steps off his treadmill before bed, puts his foot into a slipper, and is bitten. His wife, Evelyn, calls Dr. Jennings, but the old doctor is dead by the time he arrives. When County Medical Examiner Milton \"Milt\" Briggs arrives, Dr. Jennings tells him that Metcalf's wife saw a spider, then shows him a bite on the old doctor's toe. Milt argues, however, that spider bites are rarely fatal. He blames the elderly doctor's death on overexertion on the treadmill. Dr. Jennings demands an autopsy, and the next day, Briggs telephones to say Dr. Metcalf died from a tiny amount of unknown toxin. Over the objection of Sheriff Lloyd Parsons, Dr. Jennings asks Milt to exhume Todd Miller and Margaret Hollins.||||| Dr. Jennings warns his children to watch out for spiders. While playing with Bunny at the Beechwood house, Shelley Jennings is almost bitten by a spider, but Bunny innocently drops a large book on it. Meanwhile, Ross finds a cricket in the house and realizes he has not heard them lately, even though crickets chirping on quiet evenings was one of Canaima's selling points. Seeing that Dr. James Atherton, one of America's foremost entomologists, is studying spiders at a California university, he telephones him. Atherton tells him that people frequently report false outbreaks of spider deaths. However, after he hangs up, Dr. Atherton vaguely recalls the name Canaima. Studying his new species of Venezuelan spiders, he asks his assistant, Chris Collins, to investigate. Chris arrives in Canaima just as Dr. Jennings and Milt find spider bites on the exhumed bodies of Todd Miller and Margaret Hollis. The young assistant telephones Dr. Atherton and asks him to come.||||| The next day, as Dr. Jennings, Milt, Sheriff Parsons, and Chris search Margaret's property, they find a large web filled with fragments of crickets, along with a dead spider. Chris Collins observes that another spider drained it, because spiders are like vampires. Suddenly, a spider menaces them. Dr. Jennings freezes with fear, but makes enough movement to distract the spider, allowing Chris to drop a glass over it. Nearby, as Bunny's older sister, Becky Beechwood, takes a shower, a spider drops on her from the shower rod, but the rushing water sends it skittering down into the drain. Henry Beechwood telephones Delbert McClintock, who arrives and finds a spider on the front walk. The exterminator's insecticide has no effect, however, so he squashes the spider with his boot. When Dr. James Atherton arrives in town, Dr. Jennings claims that he and Irv Kendall have already figured out that a spider escaped from his Venezuelan camp in Jerry Manley's casket.||||| Studying the captured spider, Atherton notes the huge fangs and the lack of sex organs, which is uncharacteristic of spiders, except for the Venezuelan species. He explains that this type of spider has been trapped for millennia in a deep gorge, but now one of them has mated with a local species, and their offspring will spread out. Though these sexless spiders will soon die, a new queen has probably been born, and her offspring will be unstoppable. Her nest must be destroyed. That night, at Irv Kendall's house, a spider gets into a bowl of popcorn and kills him and his wife. The next day, when Atherton goes to Dr. Jennings' office with Sheriff Parsons, he sees Molly's photographs of the huge barn web and demands to go there. Elsewhere, Chris Collins tells Dr. Jennings the queen will be hiding in a dark, musty place, and no other spiders will be around because the queen protects her babies.||||| Plotting a map of where spiders were seen or people were bitten, Chris draws a circle around the Jennings house. Meanwhile, as Atherton investigates the web in the barn, the original Venezuelan spider fatally bites him. Dr. Jennings arrives to evacuate his family, but they are surrounded by hundreds of spiders and must escape through an upstairs window. However, Jennings again freezes at the top of the stairs and tumbles over the railing. He crashes through the rotted ground floor and lands in the cellar. Seeing no spiders, he knows from what Chris Collins said that this must be where the queen is hiding.||||| When it attacks him, he shovels the spider toward a broken fuse box and electrocutes her. Finding a giant egg sac, he douses it with wine. As the original Venezuelan spider drops down on him, he knocks it away, chases it with flames, and sets part of the basement on fire. He momentarily freezes as the spider crawls up his leg, then knocks it away into the fire. As the flaming creature leaps at him again, Ross fires his nail gun and sends the burning spider into the egg sac, setting it afire. Delbert McClintock pulls him to safety.

Vincent have to keep their marriage a secret when investigator, Daniel Breeden, uncovers evidence that may show that the governor took a bribe from John F. Holdstock, an embezzling financier he pardoned. John's private secretary, Willis Martin, who deposited the bribe money in the governor's private bank account, tells Robert and Daniel that he knows of no business between John and the governor that would explain the money. Sheldon goes to the Governor's Residence to tell Ruth about the situation, and that he is obligated to present the evidence to a legislative investigation committee. Ruth is certain that her father did not take a bribe, and that John can explain everything, but they learn by phone from Daniel that John has committed suicide. The Governor is concerned about the allegations, but his financial backer, Jim Lansdale, calms him down, and takes him to lunch. Before he does he makes a phone call in which he learns that Sheldon is at the Governor's residence, but he does not tell the Governor this.||||| In John's papers, Robert finds a typed note which apparently provides a motive for the bribe: \"My dear friend John ... the expense of maintaining my sockfarm has exceeded the income during the year ... the time for the matter we discussed has come. W.H.V.\" Robert rushes to show it to Ruth, and they decide to take it to police headquarters to be compared with a sample from the governor's personal typewriter. Lt. Tom Nigard shows them the comparison: both samples are definitely from the same machine. Ruth returns home to tell her father about the evidence, and he adamantly denies that he wrote the note, giving her his word of honor. That night, Daniel goes to John's office, where a very spooked Willis is still working. Daniel tries to calm him down, telling him \"You have nothing to worry about, it's almost over. I've seen you through today as I promised, haven't I? ... You were splendid today in Robert's office. You just stick to your story and remember that I'm taking care of you.\"||||| Ruth goes to Robert's apartment to tell him that she's absolutely certain her father is innocent. While she is there, Sheldon's secretary, Hazel Normandie leaves for the day, planning to meet Daniel, her boyfriend, outside the building. As he walks up to her, Daniel is shot dead. Ruth has seen everything from the window, and knows that Hazel didn't fire the shot, but cannot tell the police because of her secret marriage to Robert: if it was learned that she was in his apartment at night, she fears that their marriage will be discovered. The police investigation of Daniel's murder determines that the gun used to kill him belonged to Hazel, the same gun that Daniel took from her earlier in the day, saying that he was all the protection she needed. At a raucous session of the legislature, Representative McPherson, from the party opposing the Governor, accuses both the governor and Attorney General Sheldon of withholding evidence from the investigative committee. They are staunchly defended by Representative Grosvenor, but McPherson demands articles of impeachment against the governor and intensive investigation of Robert. Ruth observes it all from the gallery.||||| Hazel is standing trial for the murder of Daniel, with the case about to go to the jury, but Ruth still refuses to testify, knowing that the revelation of her secret marriage with Robert would end his career. With little time to waste, Ruth goes to the apartment of Willis, who appears to be cracking up. Willis admits to her that John didn't commit suicide, he was murdered, and says that he is willing to tell Robert so, but once at Robert's office he runs away; Sheldon puts out an alert for the police to pick him up. Now, with no other choice, he and Ruth head to the courthouse, where the jury is voting, and find Hazel's attorney. The judge reopens the case to allow Ruth to testify, and Hazel is acquitted. The next morning, Governor Vincent is annoyed that Ruth didn't tell him about the marriage, but understands that the circumstances necessitated it. With the governor's impeachment trial due to start soon, Jim Lansdale counsels the governor to resign, but he refuses.

Representative McPherson issues subpoenas for Willis and Robert to testify before the committee, where the existence of the typed letter apparently from the governor to John comes out. Willis admits that Daniel made him put the letter into John's files, and then sent him to John to demand the money he lost in John's crash. When John denied he had any money, Willis shot and killed him, and Daniel fixed it to look like suicide. The whole frame-up, according to Willia, is the work of Jim Lansdale, supposedly the governor's friend and financial backer: ever since the governor vetoed a highway bill that would have made him millions, Lansdale had been working to bring down his old friend.

At one point, the cow's \"pants\" drop, revealing polka-dotted underwear.

He then climbs onto the horse carriage and uses a whip to play the horse's tail like a violin. He tunes the \"horse\" by twisting his ear. The horse seems to enjoy the music and dances in an odd fashion. He skates along, floats a few feet above the ground and makes swishing movements, with his hooves, as if mimicking a mop. Bosko then takes a rake and starts playing it like a fiddle, as the horse begins trotting on two legs.||||| The scene cuts to three ducklings and their mother.

They start drinking it and soon get drunk. Their father comes over and starts drinking from the bottle too. He laughs with a deep bass guffaw and sings One Little Drink, using nonsense syllables. He gestures expressively and flings the bottle away which shatters against Bosko's head. Bosko becomes soaked in booze and inebriated. He walks over to the pigs and they sing Sweet Adeline together, barbershop style. The father pig launches into One Little Drink again, but the effort causes him to belch up a corn cob. Looking embarrassed, he uses his belly button like a knob to open the door to his stomach and puts the cob back inside.

{"Prompt": "Suppose you are a story-reteller, generate a list of main concepts to help me understand the story.\n\nStory: Host Nathan Masters pulls up to Billie Green's house and walks up to the door. As we open Nathan knocks on the door is greeted by Billie Green, doll collector. She takes him into the dining room where her black doll collection is displayed. Billie Green is watching closely as he carefully is examining the dolls. Nathan asks he was seeing. Billie reaches for one specific doll, \"Baby Nancy\" and says that this is the doll that changed the toy industry. Nathan looks at Billie in wonderment with one question, how? Green explains that before this doll other black doll representations were either negative stereotypes such as a Mamie or Uncle Tom, or the mold used was a white doll with brown paint. But this doll, Baby Nancy, she was specifically designed to have black features, natural hair and was modeled after a young black girl in the community of South LA.||||| Green turns the doll over to show the back of the neck, and shows Nathan that it is inscribed with \"Shindana Toys\" and underneath \"Division of Operation Bootstrap\". Green gives the history of Operation Bootstrap and that this organization grew from the Watts uprising by two men in particular, Lou Smith and Robert Hall, bringing training and education to the neighborhood as well as partnering with local organizations and businesses to enhance the neighborhood. Green explains that there was a shift in the community to self-identify and one of the most successful initiatives of Operation Bootstrap, Shindana Toy Company, was pivotal to this for young kids both black and white. Hester explains how the psyche behind Shindana was to give black children a doll that they could identify with as well as to teach children tolerance. The company even marketed the doll to both black and white children to teach them how to relate at a young age.||||| She goes on to explain that the success transformed the doll industry and grew so large that it opened up distribution centers in New York, Chicago, and Houston. Green points out her specific dolls and explains that they reached to celebrities like Flip Wilson and Dr. J. And they even created a \"lil cousins\" brand that which featured multicultural dolls, expanding their brand. Green shares the stories behind her dolls and personal connection behind collecting them. Nathan thanks Billie for her time and heads out. Nathan a bit blown away by all the information Green and Hester just told him, that a doll changed the toy industry and Operation Bootstrap changed a community, heeds Yolanda's suggestion and heads to a small library in the heart of South LA, Southern California Library\n\nNathan walks into the library and to the main desk asking for any materials they may have on Operation Bootstrap||||| The owner mentions that they are upstairs and to follow her\n\nNathan and the owner head upstairs and she goes down the long shelves to pull out a folder and motions to the table. Nathan sits down at the table researching the folder and seeing what he can find. Nathan is greeted by the owner and librarian at the Library and he explains that he is looking for information on Shindana and Bootstrap. She takes him up to a small research table upstairs surrounded by periodicals and brings out a small file, that reads \"20th Century Organizational Files.\" The librarian explains that there is not much left on it, and most of the stories live with the people that were involved in it. He flips to an article from Business Weekly, 1967. He reads:\n\n\"Operation Bootstrap, an ambitious self-help program in LA, is aiding hundreds of Negroes - once considered all but unemployable - to find jobs. Its program includes vocational training that makes use of $100,000 worth of equipment loaned by such firms as IBM, Singer, Litton Industries, and Scientific Data Systems.\"||||| Most narratives of the aftermath of the Watts Uprising focus on how businesses left the community...but these documents suggest that that's not the whole story, not even close. This is a story about resilience, community strength and economic revival...and outside of the black community in South LA, this story is barely known. Besides coming out of the Watts uprising, how did Operation Bootstrap start? And was a Toy Factory at the heart of it? Nathan takes a few pictures of the Operation Bootstrap documents he made and places his iPad he was taking notes on in his satchel. He puts on his hat and out the door he goes. Nathan then heads to the Dunbar Hotel to meet with Marva Smith and David Crittendon. The wife of the late Lou Smith, who was the co-founder of Operation Bootstrap, and close friend of family and Operation Bootstrap. The location of the organization is less than 300 ft from where Nathan and Marva are sitting now.||||| Smith, Crittendon and Nathan sit drinking coffee and chatting about why Lou started Operation Bootstrap, the black community in Los Angeles reacted to the existential and economic devastation of the 1965 Watts riots. Lou Smith and Robert Hall wanted to give South LA education in vocational jobs as well as remedial studies like English and math. As the conversation continues, Nathan continues to ask questions. His understanding of South Los Angeles after the riots is that businesses fled and the community was left in socioeconomic distress, but he hasn't heard this more positive narrative of self-help organizations like Operation Bootstrap let alone this toy factory! Smith goes on to say that Operation Bootstrap, however, did not just have impact on those within the community. The organization also provided an opportunity for those outside the neighborhood to have open dialogues around race and racism in 1960s Los Angeles. A clip plays from the UCLA documentary \"Sensitivity Sessions.\"||||| Smith tells him that Operation Bootstrap was extremely successful, they trained many individuals throughout the community and opened multiple businesses, and the story of one individual they saw transform before their eyes, Lewis Kiwasi. He was known as the kid in the neighborhood that did not try and did his same thing every day, but really took what Operation Bootstrap did and found a place for his potential and thrived, even to succeed Lou Smith after his passing. She suggests that Nathan sees the Conner Family, three women that thrived from Operation bootstrap, Doris Conner, was the dress designer and maker for Shindana Dolls. Nathan Masters drives up and parks out front of Irie Vibes Art Space. As Nathan arrives, the Conners have tables set up in the same way they would for their weekly sewing classes. Nathan walks into Irie Vibes and is greeted by Doris, Tuesday and Lynne.||||| Nathan meets the Conner Family: Doris Conner and her daughters Tuesday and Lynne, who all worked at the Shindana factory at its height. As Tuesday is teaching Nathan the process of pattern, pinning and sewing, he acknowledges that with the size of the company, their job must have been no small task. He asks about the impact that working for Shindana had for them. They explain that they owe their success as business owners to Shindana and Operation Bootstrap. They pull a doll out and mention, \"just like how this doll transformed the doll industry, it also transformed our lives.\" For the Conner's, and for many children in South LA and beyond, It was about seeing themselves represented in the world. But they make the point that Shindana wasn't just about making black dolls, we made Latino dolls, Asian dolls, etc. It was about equity in representation...and you'd be surprised just how much that can matter in child's life.||||| The Conner's talk about what they do today, design, act, provide a space for the community to come and have a jam session or learn a vocational job, like sewing. Lynne reflects that their mom always taught them that if you could do something with your hands you would never go hungry, From their roots they learned to be part of the community and to give back and that is exactly what they continue to do today at their own shop. The Conner's tell Nathan that Mattel funded and helped get Operation Bootstrap off the ground.||||| Nathan ends his journey at Leimert Park where he meets up with Yolanda Hester, black doll historian. Hester reaffirms the importance Shindana and Operation Bootstrap, and how the toy factory. Nathan asks Hester how Shindana affected the neighborhood and its residents. Nathan reflects that it didn't just impact the kids who owned the dolls, it succeeded in starting a grassroots economic incubator, and the ladies at Irie Vibes. As Hester and Nathan walk through the Leimert Park, they discuss how Operation Bootstrap expanded black ownership and ironically perhaps set the seed for the community's own self-gentrification, a similar characteristic to the neighborhood around them.

When they approach the hideout, they hear Beth scream as she tries to escape Snake's lascivious attentions and engage the gang in an gun battle.

Wolf and Colt prepare to turn themselves over to Gray, but he informs them that his investigations have proven that Snake is the Arizona Gunfighter, and that they are therefore free to go.

Arthur then says \"Well, now Buster 's gone crazy for dinosaurs!\" In Mr. Ratburn 's class, Mr. Ratburn announces that they will be taking a field trip to Rainbow Rock State Park where they will find different kinds of fossils. Buster is so excited that he knocks over his chair. The class arrives at Rainbow Rock State Park. Buster and Arthur arrive with Arthur carrying a heavy load of supplies. The whole class begins playing around until Mr. Ratburn alerts everyone to follow him. They enter the exhibition area and meet up with Ranger Ruth , who will be their fossil-hunting guide. She asks the class what a fossil is and Buster answers in a very scientific manner, much to everyone's surprise.||||| The show begins, and Ranger Ruth explains about life many years ago. How there were different plants, bugs and of course, dinosaurs. She further explains how the animals would die out. During this scene, the back person of the dinosaur costume accidentally falls backwards and runs away. Mr. Ratburn has the laughing class quiet down. Ruth continues and explains how certain parts of the bodies such as bones would last during the rotting time, and how water covered the land and eventually become rock and dirt, thus covering the remains turning them into fossils. After the show, the class heads out to hunt for fossils. On the way, Ruth talks to the children about how certain layers in the cliff date how old a certain fossil is depending on where it's found. Muffy asks how they are going to search in the cliffs, but Ruth says that they will be searching in the water.||||| In excitement, Francine rushes into the water and begins searching. Later that day, all the kids are still searching, with Buster and Arthur not having any luck. Mr. Ratburn notifies them that they will be leaving soon. Buster, in determination, wants to keep looking until they leave. Arthur protests at this, for the other students are having soda for a lunch break, and accidentally picks up a rock, which turns out to be a fossil. Buster notices and goes through a daze. Nervously, Arthur drops the fossil into the water, but Buster jumps after it and begins digging through the rocks rapidly until he finds it. Arthur thinks it's a leaf fossil, but Buster rebukes this and sees that it's a footprint. When the kids are gathered together, Brain shows Ruth a shell fossil and she places it into a sack. Buster notices this and is surprised to see that they don't keep them. Ruth explains to him that they take the fossils to the museum.||||| Buster is upset at this and hides the footprint in his hat. He also pretends that he and Arthur haven't found any fossils. As they leave Arthur tells Buster he should give it up, but Buster doesn't yield and still wants to keep it. Ruth meets up with them, congratulates Buster for being an excellent paleontologist and pats him on the head, where the fossil is. Because they are so nervous, they imagine Ruth as a dinosaur on the way out. On the way home on the bus, Arthur asks if they could tell someone about the fossil, but Buster denies this for he thinks it's too dangerous. When Buster gets home, he wraps the fossil in tinfoil, and stuffs it in a bag in a box of marbles to hide in his closet. At dinner, Buster's Mom asks her son if he found any fossils on the field trip, and he nervously says no.||||| The next day at school, Arthur asks if he can come to see the fossil, but Buster declines this for he thinks someone would see it. Arthur attempts to reason with Buster that there's no point on having the fossil if they can't even see it themselves.

He tells her he's been having trouble sleeping and came over to do some cleaning. As they clean the kitchen Sookie tells Jason about the werewolves and the fact she feels helpless about Bill's disappearance. Jason thinks Andy might be able to help. Sam has fallen asleep at the wheel outside the Mickens residence. He is awakened by Tommy Mickens (who her had followed from the auto repair shop) pointing a shotgun in his face.

The other guys then walk into the bank and inadvertently create a hostage situation. The police are called and the guys are faced with the consequences of Billy's actions. Sol tells them they are all accomplices and facing serious prison time.||||| However, the bank customers bond with the 5 unlikely robbers. Outside the bank Billy's dad, Sheriff Philips (Fred Ward), demands for Billy to surrender and mocks him for being a failure in life. Billy confronts his father and refuses to surrender. Inside the bank it's suggested that Billy release some of the hostages and Mayor Boar (Bill Yeager) volunteers but is mocked for being cowardly. One of the hostages, Gonzo (Brad Dourif) comes forward and offers the guys a solution to their problem. He suggests they request a chopper land on the roof and he will fly them to safety. Buzz seems to bond with Gonzo who is a Vietnam veteran, Buzz tells Gonzo that his whole dream in life was to serve in the military but due to being gay he was not allowed to serve.

As Sol re-enters the bank, Hoover informs his men that the guys will never escape and that as soon as they exit he will have his snipers gun them down.

As he finishes, he gives a rendition of Shakespeare just as Buzz walks in trying to get Billy to hurry up. Buzz stops the robbery but unveils Billy to everyone as the robber. The other guys then walk into the bank and inadvertently create a hostage situation. The police are called and the guys are faced with the consequences of Billy's actions. Sol tells them they are all accomplices and facing serious prison time.||||| However, the bank customers bond with the 5 unlikely robbers. Outside the bank Billy's dad, Sheriff Philips (Fred Ward), demands for Billy to surrender and mocks him for being a failure in life. Billy confronts his father and refuses to surrender. Inside the bank it's suggested that Billy release some of the hostages and Mayor Boar (Bill Yeager) volunteers but is mocked for being cowardly. One of the hostages, Gonzo (Brad Dourif) comes forward and offers the guys a solution to their problem. He suggests they request a chopper land on the roof and he will fly them to safety. Buzz seems to bond with Gonzo who is a Vietnam veteran, Buzz tells Gonzo that his whole dream in life was to serve in the military but due to being gay he was not allowed to serve. Gonzo seeing his pain, gifts Buzz his military jacket. Outside the FBI arrive to take over the hostage negotiation.||||| The lead agent Hoover (Raymond J. Barry) shows little regard for the hostages and plans to execute the five dimwitted robbers as soon as they exit the bank. Sheriff Philips approaches the bank and Billy finally confronts his father for being a lousy parent. The sheriff is shown to realise he was never there for his son. Billy agrees to allow some of the hostages to go, Gonzo amongst them. All of the freed hostages refuse to identify Billy or his friends. The gang negotiates for Jesse and Hope to be married in the bank and Hoover agrees for a priest to go in and perform the ceremony. During the wedding, the priest is uncovered to be a federal agent and Teddy and Buzz are shot during a struggle. Teddy, feeling like the bank robbery has woken him up, refuses to be sent to hospital for urgent care but eventually acquiesces. Buzz patches his wound and the guys plot their exit from the bank.||||| Sol goes outside and negotiates a deal with Hoover to get everyone out. As Sol re-enters the bank, Hoover informs his men that the guys will never escape and that as soon as they exit he will have his snipers gun them down. Sol and the guys with the remaining hostages exit the bank draped in a giant American flag. The snipers unable to pick out the guys refuse Hoovers orders to shoot indiscriminately (they also refuse to shoot at the flag). As everyone enters the bus, Sol tells Jesse he's sorry and Hope forgives him. He then steps off the bus as he announces the deal he brokered involved him surrendering to save Jesse and the guys.||||| Hoover, however, reneges on the deal and Sol holds him at gunpoint so the police cars let the bus go. As the bus leaves, Sol is shot by the snipers multiple times and dies. Sheriff Philips then blocks the feds with his police cruiser, giving Billy time to make a getaway. As the bus makes for the local airport the feds start to catch up, and Buzz drives the bus off the main road. Gonzo then appears in a military helicopter and Jesse and Hope escape onto the chopper. However, Billy and Buzz are unable to escape and remain behind. They get surrounded by the feds, and in a final bloody shoot out, the two best friends die but not before Buzz gets off a shot killing Hoover.

Meredith tells Jeremy that Elena is fine, she just has a slight concussion. Jeremy calls the Salvatores on the road. They can't believe Jeremy took her to the hospital when all the originals are looking to kill her to stop Alaric. One of them has to go back; the other has to deal with Klaus's desiccated body. Meredith returns to her office to find Alaric waiting for her. He takes her vials of vampire blood and dumps them out. He's reporting her to the medical board and Sheriff Forbes and Mayor Lockwood have been relieved of their duties. He wants Elena released into his custody.

Elena wakes up to Matt sitting watch. Tyler and Caroline got calls from their moms.||||| Elena apologizes to him for stringing him along and says she can't do the same thing to Damon and Stefan. Stefan comes in. Jeremy goes to pick up food at the Grille. Alaric finds him. Matt questions the wisdom of not getting Elena out of town, but Stefan is letting her decide what she wants to do. Elena goes to the door -- Elijah is there. At the Grille, Alaric asks Jeremy where Klaus' body is. Alaric wants Jeremy's help to find him and kill him to get rid of vampires. Once he's done, Alaric suggests they can put a spell on him so that Elena will be able to live out the rest of her life. The stake he has is the only thing that can kill them.||||| Elijah proposes he get the stake and his family will scatter for the rest of her life, prompting Alaric to follow them.

Matt and Caroline go to the Lockwoods where their moms tell them Alaric outed them to the council. They want them to run. Jeremy tells Matt about Alaric's proposal.

Elena tells Matt, for the first time, that Stefan saved her life when her parents' car went over the bridge. Being with Stefan helped her sort through everything after they died. She says you should love the person who makes you glad to be alive, but when she's with Damon, he consumes her. She doesn't want to chose one and lose the other.

He grabs Rebekah and slams her face off a car. She goes down. Damon attacks but he kicks him to the ground. With Rebekah and Damon both down for the count, Alaric opens Klaus' coffin.

He says she knows what she wants, a love that consumes her, passion, adventure and even a little danger. She asks what he wants, but her parents drive up. He compels her to forget they ever met, saying he can't have people know he's in town yet. Alaric continues beating on Damon and then kneels down with his stake.

Jessica denies the allegations that she is any negative influence over her husband, while Pike makes a phone cal to the house to talk with Ernest Valdemar, who speaks over the phone in a weak but coherent voice explaining about his decision to let Jessica take control of his money and assets from his personal signature on the written documents that she has. Pike reluctantly agress to let Jessica have access to the money, but wearns her that if antything were to happen of Mr. Valdemar within the next three before the transfer of his estate over to Jessica is finalized, she will be investigated by the authorities.||||| Jessica returns home to Ernest Valdemar's large suburban mansion where she meets with Dr. Robert Hoffman where it is revealed that he and Jessica have been conspiring to cheat the terminally ill Mr. Valdemar out of his estate hypnotining him and and having him do what they wish from his deathbed. Jessica dosen't like the procedure, but Robert wants it done because he used to have a romance with Jessica and wants to run off with her after they acquire his $3 million assets. The next day, Jessica goes to a bank where she withdraws $3000,000 and stores it in a safe. Robert sees this. But then, Mr. Valdemar goes into cardiac arrest and dies while under another hypnosis spell. Not wanting to reveal his death just yet, Robert and Jessica carry his body to the basement where they hide it in a freezer. But during the night, Jessica becomes frightened when she hears moaning coming from the basement, but when she tries to wake up Robert, he has put himself under a hypnotic-induced slumber to help him sleep.||||| The next morning, Jessica and Robert wake up and also hear the same noises coming from the basement. Upon checking body, they hear Ernest Valdemar's voice coming from the still body claiming that this soul is alive and trapped in a dark void between the living and the dead while under hypnosis. Vlaldemar tells them that he sees \"others\" in the dark void looking at him.||||| While Jessica goes out to make sense of this situation, she returns to find Robert talking to Mr. Valdemar's undead corpse who tells him that the \"other\" are vengeful spirits trapped in a realm and want to use him to enter our world. Valdemar tells Robert to wake him up and free him from his hypnotic state. In a panic, Jessica shoots Valdemar's corpse and wants to bury the body and skip town with the money they have. While Robert heads outside to dig a hole to bury the body, Jessica goes back into the cellar only to find Valdemar's body rising up out of the freezer and walking towards her saying that he is under control of \"the others\" to use him. Jessica shoots him, but he keepson coming. Robert enters the house when he hears the gunshots and sees Jessica and Valdemar struggling on the balcony where the undead walking cadaver shoots Jessica in the head and she falls off the balcony, dead.||||| Robert finally tells Valdemar that he's going to wake him and free from his hypnosis. But after doing so by counting to five, Valdemar tells Robert that it's too late to wake him, for without his body as a conduit, the Others cannot return to their realm. \"They're with you now!\" exclaims Valdemar, who finally falls dead. Robert then steals all the cash that Jessica had stored in the safe and flees the house.||||| Robert goes back to his apartment in downtown Pittsburgh, where he puts himself under a hypnotic sleep. Shortly after, the ghostly \"Others\" enter his apartment and kill him by shoving the hypnotic digital counter into his chest. The ghosts then form themselves into one large mass-like mist and enter Robert's dead body. Several days later, the police led by Detective Grogan arrive at Robert's apartment to answer complaints about a \"strange smell\" and constant moaning coming from the apartment. Grogan finds the apartment ransacked and the stolen cash scattered everywhere. But just then, the horribly decomposed body of Robert, under the control of the Others, appears and attacks Grogan, while telling him that there is nobody to wake him up and that he is trapped forever.||||| Rod Usher makes his entrance in a building decorated with the abject remains of dismantled corpses. A naked woman lies bound to a table, sliced in two by a huge pendulum-like blade. Rod is a professional crime scene photographer for as he puts it: \"still life's my art,\" a talent which ensures that he is frequently called upon the local authorities--led by Detective LeGrand--to document the horrors of the baroque crime scenes which are apparently commonplace in Pittsburgh where Rod lives.||||| After arriving home at a semi-fancy row house, Rod works in his darkroom in the basement developing the photos when his work is interrupted by the appearance of a mysterious black cat, which has apparently been adopted by his live-in girlfriend Annabel. Rod and Annabel's relationship is uncomfortably distant. Annabel is delicate, sensitive, and somewhat ethereal, while Rod is a rough, burly, brutish man who seem more at home with the gritty hyper-reality of crime scenes that he is with Annabel's talk of witches and superstition. Annabel, in contrast to Rod, is a professional violinist who gives private lessons to local high school students who show up at the house after their school classes, and she even takes some of them on excursions to local opera houses to watch the arts of life.||||| Over the next several days, a strong antipathy grows between Rod and the mysterious cat, a situation worsened by Annabel's excessive protection of it. Driven to distraction by the cat's apparent hatred of him, Rod eventually strangles it during a photo shoot he has set up with the cat being the center of attention. Rod then uses the photos of him strangling the cat to post on the cover of his newest photography book, titled Metropolitan Horrors , a lurid collection of his most revolting pictures.||||| As Annabel begins to guess the truth about what has happened to her pet, the couple embarks on a series of violent arguments, one of which ends with Rod falling into an alcohol-induced sleep where he has a nightmare about participating in a Medieval Pagan festival where he's executed for the murder of the cat. One day, when Annabel finally spots his book in a shop window, with the strangled body of her much-loved cat on the front cover, she immediately goes home and makes plans to leave Rod.||||| Meanwhile, Rod is drinking heavily at a local bar. He becomes unnerved when the barmaid, Eleonora, gives him a stray black cat, which is identical to Annabel's own cat. Rod notices that the inky feline has an identical white marking on its chest (an obscure white patch which seems to resemble the shape of a gallows). Rod brings the cat home and sets about to kill the feline once and for all. But Annabel intervenes and comes to the cat's rescue, causing a confrontation which ends in her gruesome death when Rod hacks her with a meat cleaver. After shaking off his suspicious next door neighbor and landlord, Mr. Pym, who arrives after hearing the argument, Rod assures him that nothing is wrong.||||| Confident that he can escape detection, Rod conceals the body behind a wall in the house and invents a story to explain Annabel's disappearance to her music students, Betty and Christian, when they show up the next day for their violin lessons. But after a confrontation with Christian, who expresses doubt and suspicion to Rod about his story of Annabel leaving him, she confides in Mr. and Mrs. Pym about her suspicions that Rod might have killed Annabel. When Annabel's friend in New York keeps phoning the house to ask about her whereabouts, Rod becomes increasingly trapped by his own increasing elaborate web of lies. The situation is exacerbated by yet another appearance of the black cat from behind the wall.

Jessica denies the allegations that she is any negative influence over her husband, while Pike makes a phone cal to the house to talk with Ernest Valdemar, who speaks over the phone in a weak but coherent voice explaining about his decision to let Jessica take control of his money and assets from his personal signature on the written documents that she has. Pike reluctantly agress to let Jessica have access to the money, but wearns her that if antything were to happen of Mr. Valdemar within the next three before the transfer of his estate over to Jessica is finalized, she will be investigated by the authorities.||||| Jessica returns home to Ernest Valdemar's large suburban mansion where she meets with Dr. Robert Hoffman where it is revealed that he and Jessica have been conspiring to cheat the terminally ill Mr. Valdemar out of his estate hypnotining him and and having him do what they wish from his deathbed. Jessica dosen't like the procedure, but Robert wants it done because he used to have a romance with Jessica and wants to run off with her after they acquire his $3 million assets. The next day, Jessica goes to a bank where she withdraws $3000,000 and stores it in a safe. Robert sees this. But then, Mr. Valdemar goes into cardiac arrest and dies while under another hypnosis spell. Not wanting to reveal his death just yet, Robert and Jessica carry his body to the basement where they hide it in a freezer. But during the night, Jessica becomes frightened when she hears moaning coming from the basement, but when she tries to wake up Robert, he has put himself under a hypnotic-induced slumber to help him sleep.||||| The next morning, Jessica and Robert wake up and also hear the same noises coming from the basement. Upon checking body, they hear Ernest Valdemar's voice coming from the still body claiming that this soul is alive and trapped in a dark void between the living and the dead while under hypnosis. Vlaldemar tells them that he sees \"others\" in the dark void looking at him.||||| While Jessica goes out to make sense of this situation, she returns to find Robert talking to Mr. Valdemar's undead corpse who tells him that the \"other\" are vengeful spirits trapped in a realm and want to use him to enter our world. Valdemar tells Robert to wake him up and free him from his hypnotic state. In a panic, Jessica shoots Valdemar's corpse and wants to bury the body and skip town with the money they have. While Robert heads outside to dig a hole to bury the body, Jessica goes back into the cellar only to find Valdemar's body rising up out of the freezer and walking towards her saying that he is under control of \"the others\" to use him. Jessica shoots him, but he keepson coming. Robert enters the house when he hears the gunshots and sees Jessica and Valdemar struggling on the balcony where the undead walking cadaver shoots Jessica in the head and she falls off the balcony, dead.||||| Robert finally tells Valdemar that he's going to wake him and free from his hypnosis. But after doing so by counting to five, Valdemar tells Robert that it's too late to wake him, for without his body as a conduit, the Others cannot return to their realm. \"They're with you now!\" exclaims Valdemar, who finally falls dead. Robert then steals all the cash that Jessica had stored in the safe and flees the house.||||| Robert goes back to his apartment in downtown Pittsburgh, where he puts himself under a hypnotic sleep. Shortly after, the ghostly \"Others\" enter his apartment and kill him by shoving the hypnotic digital counter into his chest. The ghosts then form themselves into one large mass-like mist and enter Robert's dead body. Several days later, the police led by Detective Grogan arrive at Robert's apartment to answer complaints about a \"strange smell\" and constant moaning coming from the apartment. Grogan finds the apartment ransacked and the stolen cash scattered everywhere. But just then, the horribly decomposed body of Robert, under the control of the Others, appears and attacks Grogan, while telling him that there is nobody to wake him up and that he is trapped forever.||||| Rod Usher makes his entrance in a building decorated with the abject remains of dismantled corpses. A naked woman lies bound to a table, sliced in two by a huge pendulum-like blade. Rod is a professional crime scene photographer for as he puts it: \"still life's my art,\" a talent which ensures that he is frequently called upon the local authorities--led by Detective LeGrand--to document the horrors of the baroque crime scenes which are apparently commonplace in Pittsburgh where Rod lives.||||| After arriving home at a semi-fancy row house, Rod works in his darkroom in the basement developing the photos when his work is interrupted by the appearance of a mysterious black cat, which has apparently been adopted by his live-in girlfriend Annabel. Rod and Annabel's relationship is uncomfortably distant. Annabel is delicate, sensitive, and somewhat ethereal, while Rod is a rough, burly, brutish man who seem more at home with the gritty hyper-reality of crime scenes that he is with Annabel's talk of witches and superstition. Annabel, in contrast to Rod, is a professional violinist who gives private lessons to local high school students who show up at the house after their school classes, and she even takes some of them on excursions to local opera houses to watch the arts of life.||||| Over the next several days, a strong antipathy grows between Rod and the mysterious cat, a situation worsened by Annabel's excessive protection of it. Driven to distraction by the cat's apparent hatred of him, Rod eventually strangles it during a photo shoot he has set up with the cat being the center of attention. Rod then uses the photos of him strangling the cat to post on the cover of his newest photography book, titled Metropolitan Horrors , a lurid collection of his most revolting pictures.||||| As Annabel begins to guess the truth about what has happened to her pet, the couple embarks on a series of violent arguments, one of which ends with Rod falling into an alcohol-induced sleep where he has a nightmare about participating in a Medieval Pagan festival where he's executed for the murder of the cat. One day, when Annabel finally spots his book in a shop window, with the strangled body of her much-loved cat on the front cover, she immediately goes home and makes plans to leave Rod.||||| Meanwhile, Rod is drinking heavily at a local bar. He becomes unnerved when the barmaid, Eleonora, gives him a stray black cat, which is identical to Annabel's own cat. Rod notices that the inky feline has an identical white marking on its chest (an obscure white patch which seems to resemble the shape of a gallows). Rod brings the cat home and sets about to kill the feline once and for all. But Annabel intervenes and comes to the cat's rescue, causing a confrontation which ends in her gruesome death when Rod hacks her with a meat cleaver. After shaking off his suspicious next door neighbor and landlord, Mr. Pym, who arrives after hearing the argument, Rod assures him that nothing is wrong.||||| Confident that he can escape detection, Rod conceals the body behind a wall in the house and invents a story to explain Annabel's disappearance to her music students, Betty and Christian, when they show up the next day for their violin lessons. But after a confrontation with Christian, who expresses doubt and suspicion to Rod about his story of Annabel leaving him, she confides in Mr. and Mrs. Pym about her suspicions that Rod might have killed Annabel. When Annabel's friend in New York keeps phoning the house to ask about her whereabouts, Rod becomes increasingly trapped by his own increasing elaborate web of lies. The situation is exacerbated by yet another appearance of the black cat from behind the wall. But this time, Rod ensures its death by slicing it in two with a saw, and disposes of it in a garbage dump.||||| The next day, Detective LeGrand arrives with his partner to question Rod about Annabel's whereabouts. Despite their stern questioning, Rod isn't fazed by these questions. After looking around the house, the detectives leave, but immediately come back when an eerie, distorted mewing sound is heard echoing though one of the walls.||||| Rod is handcuffed and the fake wall he put up is torn down and his crime scene is gruesomely revealed: the ever troublesome feline had given birth in Annabel's tomb and its offspring are now feasting on the remains of their mistress.

Xander looks at her, and decides that the time has finally arrived to announce that he and Anya are engaged. The gang wishes the couple well but privately share their concerns with each other. As Anya gushes about wedding plans and being married, Xander starts to look uncomfortable.||||| The gang throws an impromptu party at Buffy's house for the two. When the lack of decorations is mentioned, Willow uses a spell to fill the room with them. While Anya is grateful, Tara and Giles share a concerned look.. Later in the kitchen Tara tries to talk to Willow about her casual and increasingly excessive use of magic, while Willow fails to see anything wrong with doing so. Dawn reminds Buffy that she is spending the night at her friend Janice 's house. After Buffy approves, Dawn heads out to meet Janice for what is actually planned to be an evening of Halloween fun and teenage hijinks with two older boys named Zack and Justin. As Dawn, Janice, Zack, and Justin engage in some of the more violent Halloween pranks, breaking windows and damaging mailboxes, back at Buffy's place, Giles and Xander share a drink and talk about Xander's future. Xander almost seems to second-guess his marriage intentions and his future. Giles assures him that everything will be fine.||||| Dawn and friends find themselves in front of Old Man Kaltenbach 's house, Kaltenbach being reclusive and subject to rumor. After Janice refuses to approach the house, Dawn then bravely volunteers. As she lifts his pumpkin to smash it, the old man grabs her. Dawn's pals quickly rush her aid, but they are cheerily invited into the house. As it turns out, the man was actually a toy maker who is merely bitter about his toys becoming obsolete. Justin offers to help the old man with his special treat in the kitchen. As he prepares rice crispy treats for the kids, Justin vamps out, kills the old man, and steals his wallet. Zach and Justin debate whether to just eat Janice and Dawn, or turn them into vampires, too.

{"Prompt": "Suppose you are a story-reteller, generate a list of main concepts to help me understand the story.\n\nStory: This episode begins with a flashback to 1110 AD: Five hunters, known as members of The Five with swords stand in a circle around a witch holding a cauldron of fire, she chants a spell and lightning strikes, as she pours out the fire and the fire speeds towards the men, suddenly tattoo's appear upon their bodies. One man, later known as Alexander , raises his sword, embedded with the same symbol seen on Connors stakes. In the present day, Stefan and Damon are trying to search for any information about \"The Five\" after being told by Klaus in the previous episode .||||| Damon's cell phone rings, and the Sheriff tells him there were no remains in the hospital explosion - meaning Connor is still alive. Damon tells Stefan he needs to figure it out as he has to take Elena to college . Stefan is still trying to train Elena in her new found vampire abilities in the woods, and she reveals that Damon is the only person who can help her since Caroline is \"too good\" and Stefan has his own troubles. At the Grill, Rebekah arrives with keys for Matt , a new truck, however Matt rebuffs her attempt at an apology and walks off. Klaus is then seen smirking at Rebekah, taunting her that she tries too hard. He reveals to Rebekah's shock that the Brotherhood still exists and they have work to do, however she comments she no longer cares before walking away.||||| Damon, Elena and Bonnie take a trip to college, watching Professor Shane teach a class about witches, however Elena is concerned about whether or not she will follow Stefan and become a \"ripper\" when she feeds. Damon is unconcerned and tries to tell her to feed properly and find out for herself. In Mystic Falls, Klaus has Connor chained up inside his mansion and Stefan appears. Connor has told them nothing about what they want to know, just that he can't be compelled. Klaus leads Stefan elsewhere and reveals his history of what he knows about the Brotherhood in order to get Stefan to persuade Rebekah into revealing the information she knows. In flashbacks to 1114, Klaus narrates about his time in Italy with Elijah and Rebekah, where they crossed paths with the Brotherhood and Alexander. The Five are standing upon a stage in a village, a box in the middle which he unlocks. A man steps out of the box and immediately begins to burn, revealing they are executing vampires and they are teaching humans the dangers of these creatures. It is in this moment, Alexander and Rebekah are seen intimate with each other.||||| Back inside the Grill, April and Matt share a conversation before Rebekah appears, calling \"dibs\" on Matt. Stefan shows up and tries to get her to co-operate with him and Klaus' plans by saying he could talk to Matt about giving her a second chance. Damon and Elena are still at Whitmore and Damon spots a girl on campus and tells Elena to feed off her. Elena heads to her and fakes being in her class, then grabs her wrist, compels her and goes to feed until she spots a picture of her on her phone with a little girl, her sister.||||| Elena, feeling guilty, compels her to get back to class. Damon admonishes her and Elena lectures him about his feelings until Bonnie approaches, having talked to Shane about her grandmother and holds up a flyer about a \"Murder House Frat Party\". Rebekah arrives at Klaus' mansion and sees Connor chained up, not seeing the tattoo and believing it to be a trick. Klaus, Stefan and Rebekah sit down to eat where she will only continue if Klaus apologizes to her. Klaus soon apologizes and asks Rebekah to tell them what she knows about the Five. Another flashback reveals Alexander telling them they have the \"ultimate weapon\" to destroy vampires. Back at the dinner table, Klaus says there is one piece missing to the \"puzzle\", the tattoo, he tells the girl nearby to bring someone in. Jeremy appears and has no choice but to comply.||||| At Whitmore, Damon, Elena and Bonnie arrive at the party and Elena finds a guy drugging girls, and compels him and feeds. When she finishes, she compels him and tells Damon she wants more. At the Mansion, Jeremy is drawing Connors tattoo, and Connor tells him about what he knows about the tattoo; he met someone with it years ago who had a strong desire to kill vampires. One day, after losing track of the guy, Connors tattoo just appeared randomly and the more vampires he killed, the more it spread. Another flashback shows Rebekah and Alexander in bed.||||| He tells her about what he knows of the tattoo: the tattoos are symbols and the sword is the key to reading it. Rebekah notices a dagger meant for a \"special type of vampire\" on the nightstand and after distracting her, Alexander stabs her in the heart with it, neutralizing her. Klaus in the present then tells Stefan that the Five neutralized all the Originals in their sleep, except the dagger failed to work on Klaus due to his werewolf side. In another flashback, Rebekah wakes up with blood all over the walls and Klaus standing in front of her. Alexander is dead upon the wall, stabbed with his own sword and Klaus lectures her about her stupidity and demands to know what Alexander promised her.||||| Rebekah tells Stefan in the present day that Alexander said there was a cure for vampirism. Klaus taunts her about her choices of men and Rebekah stands up, knowing that Klaus wants the cure for Elena, and that that is the reason he brought Stefan. She walks out with Klaus telling Stefan he needs to work on her to tell him the location of the tool - the sword. At Whitmore, Bonnie and Shane talk about witchcraft and he says he can show her a few things.||||| Bonnie later walks out from his office to see Elena dancing around and feeding. She is appalled and when Elena spots her, she walks out, clearly ashamed of herself. In Mystic Falls, Klaus sees Jeremy's sketch and tells him to hurry up, shoving him by the throat against the wall when he says there is no more. Jeremy tells him that is all there is and says it grows when he kills more vampires. Klaus walks out after telling the girl to take Jeremy home and Nate - his hybrid - to keep Connor alive. Nate walks back to the room with Connor chained up and Connor manages to bite him on the ear, revealing his barbel in his mouth, able to pick the lock to his chains.||||| Elena is outside and wiping blood off her mouth and tells Bonnie she should be here with Stefan, Damon is standing behind her and tells them to hit the road. Bonnie tells him what he's playing at, that Elena is a different person, to which Damon responds she is a vampire, just like him, having fun. Rebekah arrives at the Boarding House after receiving a message from Stefan. They share a drink and talk about their reasons for wanting the cure. When Stefan reveals he would take the cure to be with Elena, Rebekah tells him the location of the sword. Klaus appears from behind them and she sees the dagger in his hand. Stefan stands in her way of escaping. She demands Klaus to dagger her like the coward he is.||||| She is hurt at Stefan's betrayal and Klaus stabs her in the chest with the dagger, watching her desiccate. Stefan is seen covering Rebekah's body with a blanket and Klaus tells him to compel Jeremy into forgetting everything he heard, and that nobody can know about the cure as he searches for the sword. Elena and Damon are back in Mystic Falls and Elena apologizes to Damon about what came over her at the party. Stefan arrives and Damon leaves. Elena tells Stefan she learned how to feed today, but she hates feeling that way. She starts crying and Stefan tells her to hold on. In Klaus' mansion, Nate walks back into where Connor is being held and as he turns his back, Connor, now free from his chains, jumps up and wraps the chains around his neck and proceeds to rip his head off. The tattoo then spreads upon to his shoulder. Shane is later seen reading a book with a picture of the tattoo on his wall when Connor walks in, demanding to know why he sent him there.\n\n \n", "original_narrative": "This episode begins with a flashback to 1110 AD: Five hunters, known as members of The Five with swords stand in a circle around a witch holding a cauldron of fire, she chants a spell and lightning strikes, as she pours out the fire and the fire speeds towards the men, suddenly tattoo's appear upon their bodies. One man, later known as Alexander , raises his sword, embedded with the same symbol seen on Connors stakes. In the present day, Stefan and Damon are trying to search for any information about \"The Five\" after being told by Klaus in the previous episode .||||| Damon's cell phone rings, and the Sheriff tells him there were no remains in the hospital explosion - meaning Connor is still alive. Damon tells Stefan he needs to figure it out as he has to take Elena to college . Stefan is still trying to train Elena in her new found vampire abilities in the woods, and she reveals that Damon is the only person who can help her since Caroline is \"too good\" and Stefan has his own troubles. At the Grill, Rebekah arrives with keys for Matt , a new truck, however Matt rebuffs her attempt at an apology and walks off. Klaus is then seen smirking at Rebekah, taunting her that she tries too hard. He reveals to Rebekah's shock that the Brotherhood still exists and they have work to do, however she comments she no longer cares before walking away.||||| Damon, Elena and Bonnie take a trip to college, watching Professor Shane teach a class about witches, however Elena is concerned about whether or not she will follow Stefan and become a \"ripper\" when she feeds. Damon is unconcerned and tries to tell her to feed properly and find out for herself. In Mystic Falls, Klaus has Connor chained up inside his mansion and Stefan appears. Connor has told them nothing about what they want to know, just that he can't be compelled. Klaus leads Stefan elsewhere and reveals his history of what he knows about the Brotherhood in order to get Stefan to persuade Rebekah into revealing the information she knows. In flashbacks to 1114, Klaus narrates about his time in Italy with Elijah and Rebekah, where they crossed paths with the Brotherhood and Alexander. The Five are standing upon a stage in a village, a box in the middle which he unlocks. A man steps out of the box and immediately begins to burn, revealing they are executing vampires and they are teaching humans the dangers of these creatures. It is in this moment, Alexander and Rebekah are seen intimate with each other.||||| Back inside the Grill, April and Matt share a conversation before Rebekah appears, calling \"dibs\" on Matt. Stefan shows up and tries to get her to co-operate with him and Klaus' plans by saying he could talk to Matt about giving her a second chance. Damon and Elena are still at Whitmore and Damon spots a girl on campus and tells Elena to feed off her. Elena heads to her and fakes being in her class, then grabs her wrist, compels her and goes to feed until she spots a picture of her on her phone with a little girl, her sister.||||| Elena, feeling guilty, compels her to get back to class. Damon admonishes her and Elena lectures him about his feelings until Bonnie approaches, having talked to Shane about her grandmother and holds up a flyer about a \"Murder House Frat Party\". Rebekah arrives at Klaus' mansion and sees Connor chained up, not seeing the tattoo and believing it to be a trick. Klaus, Stefan and Rebekah sit down to eat where she will only continue if Klaus apologizes to her. Klaus soon apologizes and asks Rebekah to tell them what she knows about the Five. Another flashback reveals Alexander telling them they have the \"ultimate weapon\" to destroy vampires. Back at the dinner table, Klaus says there is one piece missing to the \"puzzle\", the tattoo, he tells the girl nearby to bring someone in. Jeremy appears and has no choice but to comply.||||| At Whitmore, Damon, Elena and Bonnie arrive at the party and Elena finds a guy drugging girls, and compels him and feeds. When she finishes, she compels him and tells Damon she wants more. At the Mansion, Jeremy is drawing Connors tattoo, and Connor tells him about what he knows about the tattoo; he met someone with it years ago who had a strong desire to kill vampires. One day, after losing track of the guy, Connors tattoo just appeared randomly and the more vampires he killed, the more it spread. Another flashback shows Rebekah and Alexander in bed.||||| He tells her about what he knows of the tattoo: the tattoos are symbols and the sword is the key to reading it. Rebekah notices a dagger meant for a \"special type of vampire\" on the nightstand and after distracting her, Alexander stabs her in the heart with it, neutralizing her. Klaus in the present then tells Stefan that the Five neutralized all the Originals in their sleep, except the dagger failed to work on Klaus due to his werewolf side. In another flashback, Rebekah wakes up with blood all over the walls and Klaus standing in front of her. Alexander is dead upon the wall, stabbed with his own sword and Klaus lectures her about her stupidity and demands to know what Alexander promised her.||||| Rebekah tells Stefan in the present day that Alexander said there was a cure for vampirism. Klaus taunts her about her choices of men and Rebekah stands up, knowing that Klaus wants the cure for Elena, and that that is the reason he brought Stefan. She walks out with Klaus telling Stefan he needs to work on her to tell him the location of the tool - the sword. At Whitmore, Bonnie and Shane talk about witchcraft and he says he can show her a few things.||||| Bonnie later walks out from his office to see Elena dancing around and feeding. She is appalled and when Elena spots her, she walks out, clearly ashamed of herself. In Mystic Falls, Klaus sees Jeremy's sketch and tells him to hurry up, shoving him by the throat against the wall when he says there is no more. Jeremy tells him that is all there is and says it grows when he kills more vampires. Klaus walks out after telling the girl to take Jeremy home and Nate - his hybrid - to keep Connor alive. Nate walks back to the room with Connor chained up and Connor manages to bite him on the ear, revealing his barbel in his mouth, able to pick the lock to his chains.||||| Elena is outside and wiping blood off her mouth and tells Bonnie she should be here with Stefan, Damon is standing behind her and tells them to hit the road. Bonnie tells him what he's playing at, that Elena is a different person, to which Damon responds she is a vampire, just like him, having fun. Rebekah arrives at the Boarding House after receiving a message from Stefan. They share a drink and talk about their reasons for wanting the cure. When Stefan reveals he would take the cure to be with Elena, Rebekah tells him the location of the sword. Klaus appears from behind them and she sees the dagger in his hand. Stefan stands in her way of escaping. She demands Klaus to dagger her like the coward he is.||||| She is hurt at Stefan's betrayal and Klaus stabs her in the chest with the dagger, watching her desiccate. Stefan is seen covering Rebekah's body with a blanket and Klaus tells him to compel Jeremy into forgetting everything he heard, and that nobody can know about the cure as he searches for the sword. Elena and Damon are back in Mystic Falls and Elena apologizes to Damon about what came over her at the party. Stefan arrives and Damon leaves. Elena tells Stefan she learned how to feed today, but she hates feeling that way. She starts crying and Stefan tells her to hold on. In Klaus' mansion, Nate walks back into where Connor is being held and as he turns his back, Connor, now free from his chains, jumps up and wraps the chains around his neck and proceeds to rip his head off.

The \"boss\" is on his way. Enter Quarles stepping onto the porch with a broad smile. \"You must be the one they call 'Devil,'\" he says. Inside, Quarles explains that Tanner is a \"talent scout\" -- and has scouted Devil, who isn't exactly thrilled with how Boyd has treated him. \"You got something better?\" Devil asks. Quarles assures Devil that, yes, he does, and promises him a one-time only offer of improving his standard of living. In the prison yard, Dickie and Dewey are taking severe beatings at the hands of their fellow inmates. Moments later, they are taken to the infirmary, where corrupt guard Ash Murphy rages. Dewey wasn't supposed to be part of this \"plan.\" Lance ( Clayne Crawford ), the prison medic who is also in on the escape plan, jabs Dewey in the neck with a needle. Dewey goes limp. Problem solved... for now.||||| Later, Givens arrives at the prison to question Lance, who explains that he was injured when Dickie escaped in a coroner's van. The van is parked on the side of a rural road as Ash approaches driver Edward Fowler ( Ethan Wilde )... and shoots him dead where he sits. He then opens the back of the van to reveal the body bags containing Dickie, Dewey and an actual deceased inmate. Ash explains that he and Dickie will go after Mags' money while Dewey goes with Lance to hide out at a nearby motel.||||| Neither escapee is overly pleased. Givens then visits Loretta ( Kaitlyn Dever ), who notes that she has a few friends in her new life as a babysitter. After some banter, Givens asks about Mags' stash of money. Loretta thinks she might know where ol' Mags might just have kept that stash. Later, following Loretta's tip, Givens and Rachel arrive at Limehouse's enclave looking for Dickie, who they suspect is after his mom's money. The pair spar with Limehouse, who isn't about to give up any information. He does, however, invite the Marshals to a barbeque. \"I'm going to hook you up with some bacon you ain't never going to forget,\" Limehouse coos to Rachel, who is unimpressed.||||| Givens drives away... and is spotted by Dickie and Ash, who are parked nearby waiting to get past the police check point to the bridge into Limehouse's holler. Ash is furious to see the law, but Dickie doesn't appear to be too terribly surprised. Ash directs that, if they can't approach Limehouse directly, then Dickie will have to find a way to get the money. They repair to the motel where Dewey and Lance are holed up with the taciturn Combs ( Ed Corbin ) and his dimwit son Junior ( Adam Bartley ) who have a grudge against the Bennetts because of Mags' \"sell-out\" to the mining company. Dickie tries to call Limehouse. After one failed attempt to make contact because of caution by Limehouse's man, a connection is made after Dickie assures Limehouse that he \"knows how to talk\" on a 'phone. \"I assume you are aware of the situation up here,\" Limehouse says in reference to the police presence. Dickie is aware, which is why he needs Limehouse to personally deliver the \"package.\"||||| Devil returns to Johnny's recently reclaimed bar where Boyd hands him a small stack of bills. Devil, thinking of Quarles's proposition, wonders when Boyd plans to execute a big score. Boyd dismisses Devil, telling his flunky to be patient. Devil scowls. Then Givens enters. He inquires regarding the whereabouts of his own father and then tells the story of the night his mother finally left after years of abuse. Givens was just a boy. Mom ran to Limehouse territory, Nobles Hollow, where white women sometimes went for shelter because they knew their men wouldn't follow. Well, a drunken Arlo did follow, only to be \"felled\" by a young Limehouse when he tried to land a haymaker to the man. \"He beat him so bad that I had to drag him back to the car and drive him home myself,\" Givens concludes before revealing that he had just visited Limehouse today. Boyd wonders why such a visit occurred. Givens explains that Dickie and Dewey escaped prison. Boyd suggests that Givens take a closer look at the prison medic.||||| Later, Devil corners Johnny, asking about the low payment from Boyd. Devil reminds Johnny that he is in a wheelchair because of Boyd. \"There was a time I believed in Boyd Crowder,\" Devil says. \"But the man we have today is not that Boyd. Not by a long shot.\" Devil then tells Johnny about the Quarles deal. Givens, in the meantime, is parked outside the motel hideout after his tip from Boyd. He looks up to see Ash crossing the parking lot with a box full of coffee and take-out lunches. Ash stops dead in his tracks. The two stare at each other. Then Ash drops the food and reaches for his gun. Givens slams on the gas pedal and the car hurtles forward into Ash, knocking him down. When the guard somehow manages to stand and awkwardly start shooting, Givens throws the car into reverse, hitting him again. Givens then goes inside the motel room to find a cigarette still burning, but no escapees. Just then, a van peels out of the motel parking lot, closely followed by a car. Lance, Dickie, Dewey and the Combs, father and son, have left the scene.||||| Givens then extracts info from the seriously injured Ash. The plan is for Limehouse to bring Mags' money to her old store, where Dickie will meet him. Givens calls Rachel, who reports that she has just turned around a truck full of pig manure at the police check point and sent it back into the holler, and that she hasn't let any traffic out of Limehouse's holler. Realizing that Mags' money will not be delivered and that Dickie might just die because of that, Givens curses as he suspects that he now might have to save Dickie Bennett. Dickie, meanwhile, is forced into his mom's old store at gunpoint by the Combs father and son. The place has been trashed. Dickie begins looking behind the wall for the money and pulls out a battered cooler. He slowly lifts the lid when there is a pair of blasts. Ash's accomplices fall dead... and out steps Limehouse who took an old underground railroad trail to evade the police checkpoint at the bridge.||||| Overjoyed, Dickie opens the cooler to reveal a measly amount of cash, $46,313 to be precise. \"There was supposed to be $3 million in there!\" Dickie exclaims. Limehouse calmly explains that it was spent by Mags to buy up surrounding property, and that there are receipts for everything. Dickie, who suspects Limehouse, pushes away the money. He refuses to accept that amount. Dickie only asks for a shotgun, and Limehouse directs his associate to unload his and give it to Dickie. \"Are you good with this, Mr. Bennett?\" asks Limehouse. Dickie just laughs in disbelief. After Limehouse exits with his cohort, Givens pulls up to the store to hear shotgun blasts. He enters to find Dickie sitting inside. The escapee has been firing off random shots. \"I hereby surrender,\" Dickie says. \"To be very clear, I am the victim here,\" and Givens agrees, and wonders where Dewey might be.||||| Dewey has been taped to a chair in a hotel room by the medic. Lance then wheels Dickie past a long row of surgical tools. He spreads a tarp on the bed. Dewey screams -- and Lance again injects him. Once more, Dewey goes limp. The medic then calls someone on his cell. \"I may have a way for us to make some more money.\" Back at Johnny's bar, Devil and Johnny approach Boyd. Devil explains that this particular conversation has been a longtime coming.||||| Devil then pulls a gun and aims it at Boyd who feigns resignation and regret, then asks for a final indulgence from his wouldbe executioner, one last question. \"Whatever led you in your imagination to believe you could pull this off?\" Johnny then puts a gun on Devil, whose mouth drops open. Boyd rises, gun in hand, and shoots Devil in the chest. \"All I ever asked for was your loyalty,\" Boyd whispers to the stricken man who have pledged his loyalty, then reneged. \"Hurts, don't it,\" Boyd says. \"I know, I've been there, too. But I made it back, and you're not going to.\" He tells Devil to close his eyes. Then Boyd, almost gently, shoots Devil in the head.\n\n \n", "original_narrative": "Devil ( Kevin Rankin ) paces on a front porch of a nice home while Tanner Dodd ( Brendan McCarthy ) tells him to relax. The \"boss\" is on his way. Enter Quarles stepping onto the porch with a broad smile. \"You must be the one they call 'Devil,'\" he says. Inside, Quarles explains that Tanner is a \"talent scout\" -- and has scouted Devil, who isn't exactly thrilled with how Boyd has treated him. \"You got something better?\" Devil asks. Quarles assures Devil that, yes, he does, and promises him a one-time only offer of improving his standard of living. In the prison yard, Dickie and Dewey are taking severe beatings at the hands of their fellow inmates. Moments later, they are taken to the infirmary, where corrupt guard Ash Murphy rages. Dewey wasn't supposed to be part of this \"plan.\" Lance ( Clayne Crawford ), the prison medic who is also in on the escape plan, jabs Dewey in the neck with a needle. Dewey goes limp. Problem solved... for now.||||| Later, Givens arrives at the prison to question Lance, who explains that he was injured when Dickie escaped in a coroner's van. The van is parked on the side of a rural road as Ash approaches driver Edward Fowler ( Ethan Wilde )... and shoots him dead where he sits. He then opens the back of the van to reveal the body bags containing Dickie, Dewey and an actual deceased inmate. Ash explains that he and Dickie will go after Mags' money while Dewey goes with Lance to hide out at a nearby motel.||||| Neither escapee is overly pleased. Givens then visits Loretta ( Kaitlyn Dever ), who notes that she has a few friends in her new life as a babysitter. After some banter, Givens asks about Mags' stash of money. Loretta thinks she might know where ol' Mags might just have kept that stash. Later, following Loretta's tip, Givens and Rachel arrive at Limehouse's enclave looking for Dickie, who they suspect is after his mom's money. The pair spar with Limehouse, who isn't about to give up any information. He does, however, invite the Marshals to a barbeque. \"I'm going to hook you up with some bacon you ain't never going to forget,\" Limehouse coos to Rachel, who is unimpressed.||||| Givens drives away... and is spotted by Dickie and Ash, who are parked nearby waiting to get past the police check point to the bridge into Limehouse's holler. Ash is furious to see the law, but Dickie doesn't appear to be too terribly surprised. Ash directs that, if they can't approach Limehouse directly, then Dickie will have to find a way to get the money. They repair to the motel where Dewey and Lance are holed up with the taciturn Combs ( Ed Corbin ) and his dimwit son Junior ( Adam Bartley ) who have a grudge against the Bennetts because of Mags' \"sell-out\" to the mining company. Dickie tries to call Limehouse. After one failed attempt to make contact because of caution by Limehouse's man, a connection is made after Dickie assures Limehouse that he \"knows how to talk\" on a 'phone. \"I assume you are aware of the situation up here,\" Limehouse says in reference to the police presence. Dickie is aware, which is why he needs Limehouse to personally deliver the \"package.\"||||| Devil returns to Johnny's recently reclaimed bar where Boyd hands him a small stack of bills. Devil, thinking of Quarles's proposition, wonders when Boyd plans to execute a big score. Boyd dismisses Devil, telling his flunky to be patient. Devil scowls. Then Givens enters. He inquires regarding the whereabouts of his own father and then tells the story of the night his mother finally left after years of abuse. Givens was just a boy. Mom ran to Limehouse territory, Nobles Hollow, where white women sometimes went for shelter because they knew their men wouldn't follow. Well, a drunken Arlo did follow, only to be \"felled\" by a young Limehouse when he tried to land a haymaker to the man. \"He beat him so bad that I had to drag him back to the car and drive him home myself,\" Givens concludes before revealing that he had just visited Limehouse today. Boyd wonders why such a visit occurred. Givens explains that Dickie and Dewey escaped prison. Boyd suggests that Givens take a closer look at the prison medic.||||| Later, Devil corners Johnny, asking about the low payment from Boyd. Devil reminds Johnny that he is in a wheelchair because of Boyd. \"There was a time I believed in Boyd Crowder,\" Devil says. \"But the man we have today is not that Boyd. Not by a long shot.\" Devil then tells Johnny about the Quarles deal. Givens, in the meantime, is parked outside the motel hideout after his tip from Boyd. He looks up to see Ash crossing the parking lot with a box full of coffee and take-out lunches. Ash stops dead in his tracks. The two stare at each other. Then Ash drops the food and reaches for his gun. Givens slams on the gas pedal and the car hurtles forward into Ash, knocking him down. When the guard somehow manages to stand and awkwardly start shooting, Givens throws the car into reverse, hitting him again. Givens then goes inside the motel room to find a cigarette still burning, but no escapees. Just then, a van peels out of the motel parking lot, closely followed by a car. Lance, Dickie, Dewey and the Combs, father and son, have left the scene.||||| Givens then extracts info from the seriously injured Ash. The plan is for Limehouse to bring Mags' money to her old store, where Dickie will meet him. Givens calls Rachel, who reports that she has just turned around a truck full of pig manure at the police check point and sent it back into the holler, and that she hasn't let any traffic out of Limehouse's holler. Realizing that Mags' money will not be delivered and that Dickie might just die because of that, Givens curses as he suspects that he now might have to save Dickie Bennett. Dickie, meanwhile, is forced into his mom's old store at gunpoint by the Combs father and son. The place has been trashed. Dickie begins looking behind the wall for the money and pulls out a battered cooler. He slowly lifts the lid when there is a pair of blasts. Ash's accomplices fall dead... and out steps Limehouse who took an old underground railroad trail to evade the police checkpoint at the bridge.||||| Overjoyed, Dickie opens the cooler to reveal a measly amount of cash, $46,313 to be precise. \"There was supposed to be $3 million in there!\" Dickie exclaims. Limehouse calmly explains that it was spent by Mags to buy up surrounding property, and that there are receipts for everything. Dickie, who suspects Limehouse, pushes away the money. He refuses to accept that amount. Dickie only asks for a shotgun, and Limehouse directs his associate to unload his and give it to Dickie. \"Are you good with this, Mr. Bennett?\" asks Limehouse. Dickie just laughs in disbelief. After Limehouse exits with his cohort, Givens pulls up to the store to hear shotgun blasts. He enters to find Dickie sitting inside. The escapee has been firing off random shots. \"I hereby surrender,\" Dickie says. \"To be very clear, I am the victim here,\" and Givens agrees, and wonders where Dewey might be.||||| Dewey has been taped to a chair in a hotel room by the medic. Lance then wheels Dickie past a long row of surgical tools. He spreads a tarp on the bed. Dewey screams -- and Lance again injects him. Once more, Dewey goes limp. The medic then calls someone on his cell. \"I may have a way for us to make some more money.\" Back at Johnny's bar, Devil and Johnny approach Boyd. Devil explains that this particular conversation has been a longtime coming.||||| Devil then pulls a gun and aims it at Boyd who feigns resignation and regret, then asks for a final indulgence from his wouldbe executioner, one last question. \"Whatever led you in your imagination to believe you could pull this off?\" Johnny then puts a gun on Devil, whose mouth drops open. Boyd rises, gun in hand, and shoots Devil in the chest. \"All I ever asked for was your loyalty,\" Boyd whispers to the stricken man who have pledged his loyalty, then reneged. \"Hurts, don't it,\" Boyd says. \"I know, I've been there, too. But I made it back, and you're not going to.\" He tells Devil to close his eyes.

Monica tells him he's too late and she is with Chandler now but is left thrown when Richard asks if Chandler is willing to give her everything he's offering. The next day while having breakfast, Chandler (in his attempts to convince Monica he's not interested in commitment to make his proposal more surprising) talks about how ridiculous the whole concept of marriage is. However he ends up going too far, and Monica storms off thinking their relationship is not going to go any further.||||| \"Backup\" - Ross and Rachel and Phoebe and Joey or the other way around. Rachel and Phoebe discuss how they both feel happy for Chandler and Monica, but also a little jealous, and Rachel mentions that maybe they should have a \"back-up plan\" -- an arrangement with a friend that, if neither of them is married by the time they are 40, they'll marry each other. Phoebe reveals that she already has one -- Joey . Rachel goes to Ross , hoping to form a similar arrangement, but Ross tells her he already has a back-up plan: Phoebe. Rachel complains that Phoebe can't have two back-up plans, but Phoebe thinks it's just good sense to back-up your back-up, because she's already lost Chandler! When Ross and Joey discover that Phoebe has them both as a back-up, they get angry and say they want to switch to Rachel.

Monica, who is getting more and more frustrated, reveals that Richard is willing to give her everything Chandler apparently won't. Joey quickly relays this to Chandler, who realizes he has to stop messing with Monica and propose as soon as possible. Monica goes to see Richard and says wants to be with an adult.

When we last left Music City, Scarlett was preparing to leave, Avery broke up with Juliette because she slept with the odious Jeff Fordham, Luke asked Rayna to marry him onstage and then Deacon asked Rayna to marry him later, Maddie was conflicted about all of it, Will came out to Layla not knowing it was caught on camera, and everybody was singing. (Tonight several of the musical performances are live.) First up is Rayna-Deacon-Luke.||||| Rayna is confused about what to do, and after a romp with Luke in the hay, talks to Tandy about it the next morning. Tandy can't believe that she would even consider getting back together with Deacon but knows Rayna has to make her own choice. In order to assist in this choice Rayna feels like she has to tell Luke what happened with Deacon. He is understandably upset but also gets where Deacon is coming from, not wanting to lose Rayna again, but he says if it's up to him Deacon will lose indeed. Rayna reassures him that she loves him but confesses with all of their history and with Maddie she is confused about Deacon. He says he knows she needs to think about it and if she doesn't want to attend a charity event he has that evening she doesn't have to.||||| She goes home and pulls out her old albums that feature Deacon and plays them and reminisces, both about good times singing onstage and not so good ones when he was drunk and awful and including one time when Luke subbed for Deacon at one of her shows when Deacon was a no-show. Meanwhile, Deacon is preparing for a show at the Bluebird that will be broadcast live on NPR (hence the live conceit) and when he's asked by the interviewer if he and Rayna will still collaborate, Deacon says he thinks things will work out like they're supposed to. Rayna goes to Deacon and tells him that she can't take another chance on him and that Luke offers a clean slate and stability. Deacon counters that he is a safe choice and that they will always love each other and that they have Maddie. Rayna says they will raise her together and she will always love him but things have to stay the way they are. Deacon tells her to come to the Bluebird and sing with him and he knows she will change her mind. He kisses her hand, she cries they embrace.||||| Later, as he waits outside the Bluebird to go on, Luke shows up and punches Deacon in the face and asks why he couldn't just let Rayna be happy. Deacon lobs the question back at him. Because of this exchange Deacon is now confident that Rayna will be coming. When Luke goes to his charity event alone he assumes the same. They are both surprised when she is a no-show at the Bluebird but catches up on the red carpet with Luke, waving her wedding ring and declaring her love at the same moment Deacon is onstage singing about the many times he broke her heart.||||| In the audience grooving along is Maddie, who was brought their by Teddy as a conciliatory gesture to prove that he doesn't hate Deacon or music. Teddy explains that without Deacon he wouldn't have Maddie. She appreciates her father's gesture. Also participating in the live Bluebird session is Will. The morning after his confession, Layla wonders if he ever loved her. He said he did and does. She wonders what they'll do and if he can change. He doesn't know but says the camera crew is there so they have to go on with the show. Later, when he dedicates his song at the Bluebird to her it is too much and Layla runs off. On the tour bus outside they agree to split. When they try to tell the TV producer they want off the show, she shows them the footage of Will coming out and says the network signed on for a show about up and coming country singing newlyweds not a gay cowboy and his naive wife.

When we last left Music City, Scarlett was preparing to leave, Avery broke up with Juliette because she slept with the odious Jeff Fordham, Luke asked Rayna to marry him onstage and then Deacon asked Rayna to marry him later, Maddie was conflicted about all of it, Will came out to Layla not knowing it was caught on camera, and everybody was singing. (Tonight several of the musical performances are live.) First up is Rayna-Deacon-Luke.||||| Rayna is confused about what to do, and after a romp with Luke in the hay, talks to Tandy about it the next morning. Tandy can't believe that she would even consider getting back together with Deacon but knows Rayna has to make her own choice. In order to assist in this choice Rayna feels like she has to tell Luke what happened with Deacon. He is understandably upset but also gets where Deacon is coming from, not wanting to lose Rayna again, but he says if it's up to him Deacon will lose indeed. Rayna reassures him that she loves him but confesses with all of their history and with Maddie she is confused about Deacon. He says he knows she needs to think about it and if she doesn't want to attend a charity event he has that evening she doesn't have to.||||| She goes home and pulls out her old albums that feature Deacon and plays them and reminisces, both about good times singing onstage and not so good ones when he was drunk and awful and including one time when Luke subbed for Deacon at one of her shows when Deacon was a no-show. Meanwhile, Deacon is preparing for a show at the Bluebird that will be broadcast live on NPR (hence the live conceit) and when he's asked by the interviewer if he and Rayna will still collaborate, Deacon says he thinks things will work out like they're supposed to. Rayna goes to Deacon and tells him that she can't take another chance on him and that Luke offers a clean slate and stability. Deacon counters that he is a safe choice and that they will always love each other and that they have Maddie. Rayna says they will raise her together and she will always love him but things have to stay the way they are. Deacon tells her to come to the Bluebird and sing with him and he knows she will change her mind. He kisses her hand, she cries they embrace.||||| Later, as he waits outside the Bluebird to go on, Luke shows up and punches Deacon in the face and asks why he couldn't just let Rayna be happy. Deacon lobs the question back at him. Because of this exchange Deacon is now confident that Rayna will be coming. When Luke goes to his charity event alone he assumes the same. They are both surprised when she is a no-show at the Bluebird but catches up on the red carpet with Luke, waving her wedding ring and declaring her love at the same moment Deacon is onstage singing about the many times he broke her heart.||||| In the audience grooving along is Maddie, who was brought their by Teddy as a conciliatory gesture to prove that he doesn't hate Deacon or music. Teddy explains that without Deacon he wouldn't have Maddie. She appreciates her father's gesture. Also participating in the live Bluebird session is Will. The morning after his confession, Layla wonders if he ever loved her. He said he did and does. She wonders what they'll do and if he can change. He doesn't know but says the camera crew is there so they have to go on with the show. Later, when he dedicates his song at the Bluebird to her it is too much and Layla runs off. On the tour bus outside they agree to split. When they try to tell the TV producer they want off the show, she shows them the footage of Will coming out and says the network signed on for a show about up and coming country singing newlyweds not a gay cowboy and his naive wife. They realize they are stuck.||||| Also ending up stuck are Scarlett, Gunnar, and Avery. A drunken Avery, upset by his betrayal by Juliette decides to hitch a ride back to Mississippi with Scarlett.

Their screams prompt Carol and Tyreese outside and the four eliminate the walkers.||||| Later that evening, Carol talks with Lizzie about why the walkers are dangerous and why it is necessary to kill them. Lizzie says she understands now what she needs to do. Mika says she does not want to \"be mean\" by killing people and Lizzie tells her you have to, but only sometimes.

A student, Brian Wilcox, is filming footage at a diner... Brian is at the diner with his friend and roommate Mike Walker, debating about what Brian should make a movie about. As Mike goofs off with his friend's camera, they spot several girls at a booth nearby and Mike good-naturedly suggests they might take pity on Brian. One of the girls, Kate, comes over and asks if they're filming her. She discusses camera technology with Brian but is clearly attracted to Mike.||||| Later, Brian is at the house. Kate and Mike are in the next room making love. Once they're done, Kate comes out, awkwardly says hi to Brian, and goes to the kitchen. Brian, Mike, and Kate go back to the diner and Brian and Kate talk cameras. Mike doesn't know anything about cameras but Kate assures Brian that she's teaching her boyfriend about them. The friends film each other talking about what they plan to do in five years. Kate wants to be an environmentalist, a lawyer, or both.||||| Brian wants to work in Hollywood, and Mike plans to set sail to the middle of the ocean and take things easy. Brian is filming a literature lecture by Professor Ludensky on Lord of the Flies. Kate comes in and confirms that Brian is taping for Mike, who has dozed off again. As they leave, another student, Scott Parker bumps into Brian, knocking his camera to the ground. He runs off and the three friends follow. The police are securing a nearby crime scene where a student, Jacob Carter, was brutally murdered. Sam and Dean, posing as FBI agents, are on the scene. The detective in charge tells them that a neighbor woman reported growling noises and Jacob screams.||||| Back at their house, the three friends discuss what they saw and figure that it's a good thing that the FBI is checking out the murder. Mike puts on the song that was playing at the diner when he first met Kate as a gift to her. Brian asks him to come with him to test some new cameras and Mike agrees. Before he goes, he privately tells Kate that he's going because Brian doesn't have any other friends. Brian and Mike film some footage of the stadium and spot Sam and Dean nearby. They listen in as Sam figures that it's a normal murder but Dean believes that they need to dig deeper. As night falls, Brian and Mike spot Scott and his girlfriend making out behind the bleachers. She slaps Scott and walks away, and Scott spots Mike and Brian and chases after them. The friends split up and Mike records himself as he wanders in the woods. Something attacks him, dragging him off-camera. When Brian finds Mike a little later, he realizes that something has bitten his friend. However, by the time he gets Mike home, the bite mark has vanished.||||| The next day, Mike gets a checkup but the doctor can't find anything wrong with him. As he opens a door, Mike inadvertently rips it off its hinges and they realize that he is now super strong. He lifts Kate one-handed into the air and wonders if he's become a superhero. Brian decides to place cameras throughout the house. When Kate notices, Brian explains that he wants to record Mike's origin story and make a film out of it.||||| As Mike eats, Brian says that he wants to go out and get bitten so that they can both be superheroes. Mike refuses, saying that his friend doesn't want what he has. Brian begs him to do it but Mike refuses. Later, Mike and Kate are using a bong when Sam and Dean arrive at the door. As they hide, Brian answers the door and the brothers ask him if they know anything about Jacob's murder, or rumors of someone being bitten. Brian denies everything and they leave, and Kate and Mike record the brothers out on the porch as they talk about dealing with another Mayan god. They play the tape back for Brian and they wonder if Mike has become a Mayan deity.||||| That night, Kate dozes off and Mike goes to the bathroom mirror and admires himself. However, as he films himself he realizes that he is growing fangs and claws. He smashes the mirror and then goes to look at the sleeping Kate for a minute.

Scott and his friends are out patrolling the neighborhood, looking for the killer animal.||||| Scott films himself and spots Mike, who says that he isn't in the mood for Scott's antics. Mike runs off into the woods and Scott chases after him, calling him a coward and saying that he'll go after Kate if Mike won't turn around and fight him. As Scott tries to spot him, Mike transforms and attacks him. The next morning, Brian wonders if Kate is scared of Michael but she says that his being a superhero is kind of hot. Mike comes in, covered in blood, and his friends stare at him in horror. He takes a shower to wash off the blood and then tells them that he killed Scott. They go over the footage that Mike filmed in the bathroom and see his claws, and Kate tells Brian to turn off the camera.||||| Brian goes to the park where Scott was killed and watches while Sam and Dean talk to the local detective. He tells the brothers that the same thing killed Scott as Jacob and that it left Scott's partially-eaten heart in the street. Michael goes back and tells his friends what happened, but Mike doesn't remember eating the heart. Kate insists that it was self-defense but Brian points out how unlikely that is and snaps at Mike. Mike shoves him across the room with one hand and then creaks down. When he says that he doesn't know who he is anymore, Kate says that he's hers. Brian insists that they have to call the police and that Mike is risking himself and them.||||| Kate angrily tells him that he doesn't understand because he's never been in love and sets out to get some answers about Mike's condition.

Once they leave, Kate wants to follow but Mike doesn't see the point. Brian arrives, having tracked his friends' cell phone GPSs. They wonder if he can hack anything and he assures them that he can. They follow the Winchesters to a diner and Brian hacks the security camera. Mike goes in with a hidden camera and sits at the table next to the brothers. The three friends watch and listen as Sam finds an entry about how close descendants of the Pureblood can control their change and subsist on animal hearts. The brothers figure that one of the purer werewolves came to town, killed its victim, and then decided to stay.||||| The three friends return to their house and Mike starts to panic, figuring the 'FBI' is after him. Kate doesn't believe that the Winchesters are FBI and that they'll start by looking for the pureblood. Mike doesn't believe it and goes to his bedroom and Kate goes after him. They argue while Brian goes over the footage of the original attack on Mike. He spots something on the ground and calls to Kate, but she slams the door shut.

Later, Brian comes home and finds Kate packing. As Mike comes out, Brian says that he took care of things and they ask what he did. He shows them footage of his confronting Ludensky and asking the professor to bite him as well. He warns the professor that he hid cameras in his office in advance and is transmitting the video to his laptop at home. Ludensky denies being a werewolf until Brian threatens him with a silver blade. Then he breaks down and explains that after the one murder ten years ago, he only ate animal hearts. However, he saw Jacob, weak and alone, and couldn't resist. Ludensky figured that hunters would come eventually so he needed a patsy. He chose Mike since he's always sleeping in and the professor figured that no one would miss him. Brian says that he wants to become a werewolf and forces the professor to bite his arm.||||| As the footage ends, Brian starts to transform and shows him footage of the office after he left. Sam and Dean come in and attack Ludensky, eventually killing him. With his dying breath, the professor thanks them. The brothers find the camera and take it down, cutting the transmission, and Brian figures that they're safe. He tells Kate that he protected her when Mike couldn't, but Mike figures the Winchesters will trace the feed back to Brian. Brian, angry and disgusted, tells Mike that he's tired of living in his shadow and that he finally has what he wants. Mike tries to persuade his friend that he doesn't want the horror inside of him, the horror that he experienced when he went out of control and killed Scott. Brian tells Kate that she needs him and grabs her, and Mike transforms and attacks him. The two students struggle and Brian stabs Mike with the silver dagger, killing him. Kate goes to her lover, who says with his dying breath that he loves her.||||| Kate tries to stab Brian, who easily grabs her and says that she'll understand... and then bites her.

Afterward, she covers Mike's corpse with a sheet and then sits down at the computer to record her message to the Winchesters.||||| She tells that she and her friends weren't monsters and didn't want what happened to them. Kate then says that she's leaving and that she will eat animal hearts and never hurt anyone, and promises that they won't hear about her. Before signing off, Kate tells the Winchesters to give her a chance. Sam and Dean look at the computer and wonder what to do next. Sam hesitantly suggests that they let her leave. Much to his surprise, Dean agrees, saying that they should give Kate a chance. They can always kill her if she fails to keep her promise. They collect all of the evidence that werewolves were there and leave.
