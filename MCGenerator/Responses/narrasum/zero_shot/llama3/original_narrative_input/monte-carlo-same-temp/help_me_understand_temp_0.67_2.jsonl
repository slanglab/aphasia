{"Prompt": "Suppose you are a story-reteller, generate a list of main concepts to help me understand the story.\n\nStory: Victim: Four victims (deceased) On the case: Gil Grissom, Nick Stokes, Sara Sidle\n\nGrissom, Nick and Sara arrive on the scene of a mass murder, four Buddhist monks from Thailand lay dead in their temple. Another monk, Ananda, who claims to have been at a bank depositing money they'd gathered to build a school during the murders, called for help. Each victim was shot between the eyes at close range, one at a time. A gang sign belonging to a gang known as \"The Snakebacks\" is carved into the wall. Grissom concludes that they sat still because they were praying for whoever shot them. In a temple garden, Grissom finds a potential murder weapon, a rifle.||||| When the room is processed, Sara extracts a recent boot print from the carpet floor, even though shoes are not supposed to be worn inside a Buddhist temple. She also finds a trace amount of a blue material on a statue and a used chewing gum on another. When Ananda's office is searched, the CSIs find a porn magazine, which is strange since Buddhism discourages seeking pleasure. The lab confirms that the rifle is the murder weapon. It also has Ananda's prints on it. At the autopsy, Doc Robbins explains that the area where all victims were shot corresponds to the Sixth Chakra. In Buddhism, the Chakras are the body's seven energy centers. The Sixth Chakra, also known as \"the Third Eye\", is the hub of higher consciousness. When Ananda is brought in for questioning, he explains that he found the rifle in his office and carried it outdoors because his faith doesn't allow weapons in the temple. The porn magazine was left in the temple by a visitor and Ananda kept it in case that person came back for it.||||| A further fingerprint analysis confirms that Ananda never touched the trigger of the gun; the locations of the prints are consistent with his story that he only carried the gun. Nick suspects that the gang sign is a false lead; after a number of murders, the LVPD came down hard on the Snakebacks and brought the whole gang down. Through David in autopsy, Grissom contacts a local Air Force base. Since 9/11, they keep satellite surveillance of bases and other key buildings. Since the temple is close to a base, it is within the range of a satellite. A photo shows a car with vanity plates \"PROUDUS\" outside the temple close to the time of the murders. The car is registered to Peter Hutchins Sr., a local diner owner who was unhappy with the monks having a temple so close to his establishment, blaming them for the drop in local stores' business. Inside the car, Sara finds a set of prayer beads that doesn't belong to Hutchins Sr.||||| At the lab, the CSIs learn that Peter Hutchins Sr. has an alibi for the murders. Greg examines the blue substance found on a statue and determines that it is paintball paint. Grissom, Nick and Sara visit a nearby paintball field, where Hutchins' son, Pete Hutchins Jr., is playing. Sara compares a shoe print left by his boot to the boot print found on the scene and sees that it is similar. Pete is brought in for questioning, accompanied by his father, and denies having been to the temple.||||| When pressured with the boot print, Pete claims to have brought some friends in to look into the rumors that there was money and drugs inside. When Grissom remarks that the lab's dust lifter only works on recent prints, Pete confesses that a friend took a gold statue from the temple when they were there. He went there to return it and found the monks as he was taking off his boots. He didn't call the police because he was afraid that he would become a suspect. When Grissom asks how he knew he was supposed to remove his boots when entering the temple, Pete admits, to his father's shame, to being interested in Buddhism and considering the monks his friends.||||| With Pete cleared, Greg examines the chewing gum found on a statue and finds trace amounts of curry and saffron on it. Grissom consults with Ananda and presents the lab's findings to him. The spices found on the gum suggest that someone ate them and then chewed the gum. Ananda shows Grissom the temple's kitchen, the cooking of which uses curry and saffron. O'Riley confronts the two with some new evidence: even though the monks raised ca. $13 000 for their charity project, Ananda only deposited $12 000 when he was at the bank. The account was opened the same day as the murders were committed.||||| Before that, Ananda kept the money in a box in his office. Grissom examines the box and finds curry powder inside. Suspicion falls on the temple's part-time cook, David Suddahara, whom Ananda caught stealing from the charity fund, which is why Ananda opened a bank account to keep the money safe. In interrogation, Suddahara confesses to the murders and Grissom confirms that his DNA matches that from the chewing gum from the scene. He thought Ananda was going to report him, went home, got his rifle and returned. Finding that Ananda was gone, he panicked and executed the monks, one by one. When Grissom asks Suddahara why he shot the monks in the Sixth Chakra, he only replies \"I shot them between the eyes.\" With the case closed, Grissom pays a visit to the temple and sees Pete Hutchins Jr. engaged in meditation with a monk.||||| Victim: Stephanie Watson (deceased) On the case: Catherine Willows, Warrick Brown In a separate storyline, Catherine meets up with Jimmy Tadero, her old mentor, at bar. Catherine brings up Dwight Kelso, who was convicted of killing her best friend, Stephanie Watson, during her dancer days. Kelso, who recently died of cancer in prison, made a television appearance on his deathbed. He confessed to killing a man in Reno, but maintains that he didn't kill Stephanie. Even though Kelso had been seen harassing her at the bar and had a knife cut on his hand when he was arrested a block away from the murder site, Catherine still feels insecure about the case. Together with Warrick, she signs out the case evidence, which is due to be destroyed, and re-examines it in the lab. When she and Greg examine the murder weapon, a bloody knife, they notice a small spot of blood that wasn't examined at the time of the murder. Catherine figures that it was ignored because the lab couldn't get a DNA sample from such a small amount.||||| When the test results come back, they show that the small spot is not from Kelso or Stephanie, but a third contributor, a male. Ecklie is initially a bit angry that the evidence was signed out without his knowledge, but gets onboard when he learns of the new evidence. In the display room, Warrick goes over the crime scene photos and notices that a glove that belonged to Kelso and was found on the scene isn't in a single crime scene photo or sketch. Catherine becomes suspicious when she learns that it was logged by Jimmy - two days after the murder. Catherine takes Jimmy to the crime scene to go over the crime again. He shows her the dumpster in which the glove was found, claiming the arresting officer didn't see the glove because it was dark and he was busy grabbing Kelso. Jimmy is offended when Catherine asks whether he tampered with the evidence.||||| Back at the lab, Warrick runs more tests on the knife and finds remains of saliva in the blood on both the glove and the knife - Kelso's saliva. Catherine suspects that the blood came from a mouth injury and was then transferred from the glove onto the knife. She confronts Jimmy, who admits that he \"helped the evidence along\". When Kelso was arrested, the DA didn't feel like there was enough non-circumstantial evidence to charge him with the murder and he was released. Jimmy attacked Kelso outside, beating him while he taunted him about the murder. Jimmy then shoved the glove into his face, where blood from his beaten mouth stained it. He then transferred some of the blood from the glove onto the knife, planting DNA evidence. Catherine tells him that, with all the new information, Jimmy is a suspect for the murder himself since he had a crush on Stephanie and even proposed to her a week before she was killed, though she turned him down. He refuses to give her a sample of his DNA without a warrant, which Catherine gets.||||| When the DNA test results come back, Jimmy is brought in for questioning. The test proves that the blood on the knife is not his, nor is it a match to anyone connected to the case or anyone in CODIS. Jimmy is furious when he learns that Catherine will make sure he is prosecuted to the full extent of the law, even though he could get life in prison or even the death penalty. He calls Catherine ungrateful, saying she would have started prostituting herself if he hadn't gotten her out of dancing. Catherine rebuts this, saying she earned her career as a CSI and only danced. She remarks that Jimmy sold his integrity to get a case solved and because of that, the real killer got away with it. She asks \"Between the two of us, who's the whore?\". She promises to follow Jimmy all the way through his proceedings and has him arrested. In the final scene of the episode, Catherine returns the Stephanie Watson evidence to the storage and marks the box \"DO NOT DESTROY - CASE UNSOLVED\".\n\n \n", "original_narrative": "Victim: Four victims (deceased) On the case: Gil Grissom, Nick Stokes, Sara Sidle\n\nGrissom, Nick and Sara arrive on the scene of a mass murder, four Buddhist monks from Thailand lay dead in their temple. Another monk, Ananda, who claims to have been at a bank depositing money they'd gathered to build a school during the murders, called for help. Each victim was shot between the eyes at close range, one at a time. A gang sign belonging to a gang known as \"The Snakebacks\" is carved into the wall. Grissom concludes that they sat still because they were praying for whoever shot them. In a temple garden, Grissom finds a potential murder weapon, a rifle.||||| When the room is processed, Sara extracts a recent boot print from the carpet floor, even though shoes are not supposed to be worn inside a Buddhist temple. She also finds a trace amount of a blue material on a statue and a used chewing gum on another. When Ananda's office is searched, the CSIs find a porn magazine, which is strange since Buddhism discourages seeking pleasure. The lab confirms that the rifle is the murder weapon. It also has Ananda's prints on it. At the autopsy, Doc Robbins explains that the area where all victims were shot corresponds to the Sixth Chakra. In Buddhism, the Chakras are the body's seven energy centers. The Sixth Chakra, also known as \"the Third Eye\", is the hub of higher consciousness. When Ananda is brought in for questioning, he explains that he found the rifle in his office and carried it outdoors because his faith doesn't allow weapons in the temple. The porn magazine was left in the temple by a visitor and Ananda kept it in case that person came back for it.||||| A further fingerprint analysis confirms that Ananda never touched the trigger of the gun; the locations of the prints are consistent with his story that he only carried the gun. Nick suspects that the gang sign is a false lead; after a number of murders, the LVPD came down hard on the Snakebacks and brought the whole gang down. Through David in autopsy, Grissom contacts a local Air Force base. Since 9/11, they keep satellite surveillance of bases and other key buildings. Since the temple is close to a base, it is within the range of a satellite. A photo shows a car with vanity plates \"PROUDUS\" outside the temple close to the time of the murders. The car is registered to Peter Hutchins Sr., a local diner owner who was unhappy with the monks having a temple so close to his establishment, blaming them for the drop in local stores' business. Inside the car, Sara finds a set of prayer beads that doesn't belong to Hutchins Sr.||||| At the lab, the CSIs learn that Peter Hutchins Sr. has an alibi for the murders. Greg examines the blue substance found on a statue and determines that it is paintball paint. Grissom, Nick and Sara visit a nearby paintball field, where Hutchins' son, Pete Hutchins Jr., is playing. Sara compares a shoe print left by his boot to the boot print found on the scene and sees that it is similar. Pete is brought in for questioning, accompanied by his father, and denies having been to the temple.||||| When pressured with the boot print, Pete claims to have brought some friends in to look into the rumors that there was money and drugs inside. When Grissom remarks that the lab's dust lifter only works on recent prints, Pete confesses that a friend took a gold statue from the temple when they were there. He went there to return it and found the monks as he was taking off his boots. He didn't call the police because he was afraid that he would become a suspect.

{"Prompt": "Suppose you are a story-reteller, generate a list of main concepts to help me understand the story.\n\nStory: Bill Markham (Powers Boothe) is an engineer who has moved to Brazil with his family to work on a large hydro-electric dam. The film opens on Markham, his wife Jean (Meg Foster), his young son Tommy (William Rodriguez), and his daughter Heather (Yara Vaneau) having a picnic on the edge of the jungle, which is being cleared for the dam's construction. Tommy wanders from the cleared area, and an Indian (Rui Polanah) from one of the indigenous tribes known as the Invisible People notices Tommy and takes him. Markham pursues the pair into the forest but does not find his son. Ten years later, the dam is nearing completion. A 17-year-old Tommy (Charley Boorman), now called Tomme, has become one of the Invisible People. When his father, Chief Wanadi, the man who took and adopted Tommy, notices Tomme is now smitten with girls, he initiates Tomme's coming-of-age rite, after which Tomme undergoes a vision quest. Tomme's spirit animal tells him he must retrieve sacred stones from a remote spot deep in the jungle. Wanadi warns him that the quest will be dangerous, as it will take him into the territory of the cannibalistic Fierce People.||||| Meanwhile, Markham has finally identified his son's abductors. Markham and a journalist decide to set off bottle rockets to attract the attention of the Invisible People. Instead, they attract the Fierce People and are captured. Armed with a CAR-15 carbine, Markham is able to defend himself long enough to talk with Chief Jacareh (Claudio Moreno) who releases Markham for the night, promising to hunt him down in the morning, while the Fierce People kill and butcher the journalist. Close to dawn, Markham stumbles into Tomme collecting the sacred stones. The two recognize each other just as the Fierce People arrive, shooting Markham in the shoulder. Tomme and his father manage to escape, leaving Markham's carbine behind. In the care of the Invisible People, Markham recovers from his injuries and discovers that his son has chosen a wife, a young woman named Kachiri (Dira Paes).

The Governor then goes to join the army of men ready to attack the prison. Tyreese (Chad L.

Outside, Eugene, Abraham and Rosita discover a working car. Eugene convinces Rosita to let him navigate. With Abraham asleep in the back seat, Eugene and Rosita drive until the he demands that she stop ... right at the mouth of the tunnel exit. Eugene has calculated that, if Glenn and Tara traveled at around 3 MPH, they would either nearby or just about to emerge from the tunnel.

After that, Abraham, Eugene, Rosita and whomever else will continue on to Washington. The next morning, Daryl exits the warehouse to find a badly beaten Len in the dirt with an arrow in his eye. He continues with Joe and the group to Terminus. Speaking of, Glenn and Maggie's group come upon a large building at the end of the railroad tracks. Terminus. Outside are plants growing in well-kept gardens. Inside, a middle-aged woman named Mary greets them with a smile. \"Let's get you settled ... Welcome to Terminus.\"\n\n \n", "original_narrative": "Eugene \"entertains\" Tara with a theory that the current undead plague might've taken out the dinosaurs. He also talks incessantly about video games. One wonders if he really is the key to saving humanity. Later that night, Abraham sits with Tara and suggests that she might have complicated feelings for Glenn. Tara alludes to the fact that she is helping Glenn because of something in her past, something she did. \"We've both got our reasons,\" she says. \"We both have our missions.\" The next day, the group comes upon a sign written in blood. \"Glenn, go to Terminus. Maggie.\" Glenn breaks out into a run, smiling. Elsewhere, Rick, Carl and Michonne walk along the railroad tracks. Carl and Michonne continue to joke around, bringing a rare smile to Rick's face. Daryl, meanwhile, hunts for a rabbit when one of the marauders he's traveling with fires first, claiming the meat for his own. When Daryl refuses, Len begins to tease Daryl about losing a woman. The remark hits too close and Daryl pulls his knife when Joe intervenes. Joe cuts the rabbit in half, explaining that they all must play by the \"rules\" in order to survive.||||| This not bode well for Daryl. Or Len. Tara injures her leg in a run-in with some walkers, but Glenn wants to push forward. Rosita comes to her defense, noting Tara will do anything that Glenn says. Glenn negotiates a deal: the group continues walking until sundown, at which point Glenn will give Eugene his walking gear before going off on his own. Abraham agrees. Unfortunately, they soon come to train tunnel. Going around will take a day.||||| Naturally, Glenn refuses to wait so Abraham declares that they'll part ways now. It's simply too dangerous to Eugene -- to them all. Glenn and Tara head into the tunnel. Daryl and his new gang find an abandoned warehouse full of cars. All the gas is gone -- someone beat them to it -- but it does provide a good place to rest. The gang all \"claim\" cars in which to sleep before Daryl can, leaving him to recline on the ground. He doesn't seem to mind. In the tunnel, Glenn and Tara come across dozens of walkers trapped in what appears to be a minor cave-in. They do some stabbing and then climb over the bodies, revealing dozens and dozens more.||||| Glenn and Tara take to the high ground on top of a rock pile. \"We have to find another way,\" Tara says. Even Glenn finds it difficult to argue with that one. So they try to slip around the walkers, sneaking down the side of the rock pile. Unfortunately, Tara slips and gets her leg wedged in some rocks. Outside, Eugene, Abraham and Rosita discover a working car. Eugene convinces Rosita to let him navigate. With Abraham asleep in the back seat, Eugene and Rosita drive until the he demands that she stop ... right at the mouth of the tunnel exit. Eugene has calculated that, if Glenn and Tara traveled at around 3 MPH, they would either nearby or just about to emerge from the tunnel. Rosita explains that the priority is getting Eugene to Washington, not waiting for Glenn and Tara. \"After the I save the world, I still have to live with myself,\" Eugene says.||||| In the warehouse, Len discovers his half of rabbit is missing and accuses Daryl. \"You take his rabbit, Daryl?\" Joe asks. \"Tell me the truth.\" Joe empties Daryl's bag and, sure enough, there is the rabbit. Daryl accuses Len of planting the rabbit. Joe seems unsure -- and then punches Len in the face. \"I saw him do it,\" Joe says with a shrug. As punishment for breaking one of the cardinal rules, the group starts to beat Len with a brutal series of punches and kicks. It continues and continues. In the tunnel, Glenn refuses to leave Tara. They are about to be devoured when suddenly car lights appear. Then, a volley of gunfire cuts down all the walkers.||||| One of the gunmen is none other than Maggie. She hugs, cries and kisses Glenn. Glenn hugs, cries and kisses back. Later, it is revealed that Maggie is with Rosita, Abraham and Eugene. Bob and Sascha are there, too.

{"Prompt": "Suppose you are a story-reteller, generate a list of main concepts to help me understand the story.\n\nStory: Just after World War II, American Steve Pitt arrives at an Italian village looking for Father Paolo, but instead finds a new priest, who tells him that Paolo was executed by the Germans. The priest knows who Steve is by letters he had written to Paolo talking about a woman named Nina, and asks Steve to tell him about the war. Steve relates what happened in 1944, when Italy was still occupied by the Germans: As a fighter pilot and squadron leader in Corsica, Steve completes his 200th mission and is about to be shipped home. When his replacement and good friend, Captain George Peterson, does not return from a mission needed for the impending invasion of Italy, Steve decides to take his place the next day. The squad cannot identify their strategic target, a tunnel that houses a German munitions supply, and Steve is forced to parachute out of his plane after it is hit.||||| Although the German ground soldiers see Steve's descent, he eludes them and seeks help from a local farmer. The farmer's wife fears the Germans and turns him away, but Steve is soon approached by Nina, a young woman who is part of an Italian guerrilla force. Nina leads Steve to a mountain cabin where he meets Bruno, leader of the small band. Although he is a patriot, Bruno fears that Steve's presence will bring severe retaliations against the villagers, including his mother, and tells Steve that he will have to stay put before finding his way back to Corsica. A few days later, Steve sees a formation of American planes fly overhead and realizes that the target still eludes them. He and Nina, who are attracted to each other, kiss, even though Steve has told her that he has a girl at home. Later, Steve tells Bruno that he is planning to leave that night.||||| Although Aldo, an embittered member of the band who is in love with Nina, lashes out at Steve, Bruno defends him and agrees to help. In the afternoon, the men go down from the hills, stop a German Panzer with a grenade and steal its weapons. A few minutes later, a truck full of German soldiers arrives, but the Italians manage to escape. Back at the cabin, Steve tells the men about the tunnel, but Bruno and the others are afraid that if they help, German retaliation will be too severe. Nina lashes out at the men for being too afraid to take chances, then leaves the cabin. Steve follows her and kisses her, promising that he will be with her even after the war, but telling her that she cannot come with him now. She agrees, but asks him to wait until morning when Father Paolo, who is a fearless patriot, can help him.||||| The next day, Nina takes Steve to see Fr. Paolo, who has been hiding George in the church since he was shot down. Paolo then reveals that Bruno's mother died when she fell from a truck, trying to escape from the Germans. Just then, two German soldiers barge in, with guns drawn. Nina distracts the soldiers by screaming, and in the melee, the Germans are killed. George, Nina and Steve then return to the cabin. On the way, they see a German roadblock and Nina distracts the soldiers long enough for George and Steve to capture them. That night, at the cabin, Nina tells Bruno what happened to his mother and he decides to help Steve blow up the tunnel.||||| During the planning, they observe that Aldo is gone, and when he returns carrying a goat, Nina is suspicious because Aldo hates goats. Later, the men notice an unusually large number of German patrols. At the same time, two of the men, Mario and Ettore, are captured by the Germans while getting supplies. Although Ettore is killed, Mario escapes. Meanwhile, at the cabin, Bruno begins to suspect that there is a spy in the group. Just then Mario comes back and tells them what happened. Convinced that someone is a traitor, Bruno suggests a secret vote to determine who it is. Steve does not like this, and refuses to vote, but everyone else, except Aldo, names Aldo. Bruno is about to beat the truth out of Aldo when German soldiers approach the cabin in force.||||| Bruno and the others tie Aldo to a chair and shoot their way out, leaving Aldo to be killed by the Germans. Next morning, Steve, George and the others move into place to blow up the tunnel, while American planes fly overhead. After Steve lights a flare he has kept in his pocket, some of the planes investigate, identify the semi-obscured target and start to bomb it. While the Italians take out some of the German artillery crews, Bruno is killed, but the rest manage to direct one of the large guns to explode the ammunition, thus destroying the tunnel. A short time later, on the coast, Paolo and other patriots help Steve and George escape in a small boat.

{"Prompt": "Suppose you are a story-reteller, generate a list of main concepts to help me understand the story.\n\nStory: Forty years after the Haddonfield murders in 1978, two journalists, Aaron Korey and Dana Haines, travel to Smith's Grove Sanitarium to interview Michael Myers, who was captured after Dr. Samuel Loomis shot him off of the Doyle house balcony at the end of the movie. Dr. Ranbir Sartain, Michael's new psychiatrist after Dr. Loomis' death, inform them that Michael is able to speak, but chooses not to.||||| Dana records the event as Aaron approaches Michael and talks to him, but fails to get him to speak, even after showing him his mask and mentioning Laurie Strode. The two journalists leave Smith's Grove Sanitarium and drive to Laurie's house, a heavily fortified and decrepit homestead, and bribe her for an interview, which she reluctantly accepts. Laurie has spent the last forty years dealing with post-traumatic stress and preparing for Michael's inevitable return. Her feelings have resulted in two failed marriages and losing custody of her daughter Karen at a young age. Aaron and Dana tell Laurie their interest in finding out why Michael committed the murders in 1978 and ask her to meet with him in a final attempt to get him to speak before he's transferred to a maximum security prison. Laurie kicks them out of her house, but not before taking the money they offered.||||| Allyson with her friends As the transport is being prepared and patients are loaded onto the bus, Dr. Sartain insists on accompanying Michael, and the bus departs. In Haddonfield, Laurie's granddaughter and Karen's daughter, Allyson, is walking to school with two friends and tells them the stress that her family endures due to her grandmother's past, and debunks the town rumor that Michael is Laurie's brother. In class, Allyson looks out of the window to see Laurie watching her.||||| She meets with her grandmother who gives her the three thousand dollars from Aaron and Dana and tells her to have fun. During a family dinner at Karen's house, Laurie arrives and has a panic attack and Allyson comforts her. Meanwhile, the bus transport crashed in a ditch, the security guards were killed, and the inmates were scattered about the road. A man and his son driving down the road happen upon the bus and investigate. While the father disappears, his son grabs a rifle from the truck and encounters a fatally wounded security guard that tells him to run. He investigates the bus and is startled by Dr. Sartain, shooting him in the shoulder accidentally. Fleeing back to the truck, he calls the police; Michael appears from the back seat and kills him.||||| The following morning, Sheriff Frank Hawkins explains to a deputy that Michael Myers escaped the transport and will most certainly return to Haddonfield to finish what he started four decades prior. Aaron and Dana arrive at a gas station; Dana leaves Aaron to use the bathroom while he goes inside to pay for the gas. With the inside of the station deserted, he stumbles upon a dead mechanic missing his overalls and a cashier whose jaw was ripped open. Meanwhile, Michael attacks Dana in the bathroom, and when Aaron arrives to save Dana, Michael kills him by bashing him into the door numerous times, killing him, before strangling Dana to death. Michael inspects their vehicle and recovers his mask, putting it on. Laurie learns about the transport crash and breaks into Karen's house to demonstrate her lack of security. After a brief argument about Michael with Karen and her husband, Ray, Laurie leaves and heads to the gas station in time to witness the bodies of Aaron and Dana being recovered.||||| On Halloween night, Michael wanders a populated street in Haddonfield, littered with families and children trick-or-treating. He finds his way into a shed behind a house and takes a hammer before going inside to kill the sole occupant. He replaces the hammer with a kitchen knife and moves to the house next door, killing another woman by stabbing the knife through her throat. Allyson is at a school-sanctioned Halloween party with her friends and receives a call from Vicky, inviting her to come over once Julian, the kid she's babysitting, falls asleep.||||| Allyson gets into an altercation with her boyfriend, Cameron, who throws her phone, just as Laurie was calling to warn her to go home. At Julian's house, he tells Vicky that he saw a masked man standing in the doorway, but Vicky dismisses it as his imagination and puts Julian to bed as her boyfriend, Dave, arrives. As Vicky checks the closet at Julian's request, she opens the door and is attacked by Michael who was hiding inside; Julian flees the house and calls the police. Laurie, patrolling the streets in her truck, hears the dispatch call on her CB radio and hurries to the house, where Sheriff Hawkins is investigating. He finds Vicky's corpse and Laurie shoots Michael through a window, only to find out it's his reflection in a mirror. Laurie and Hawkins patrol behind the neighboring houses and find Michael; Laurie shoots him, but as she turns the corner, Michael is gone.||||| Laurie and Allyson\n\nAllyson ditches her boyfriend at the party and allows her friend Oscar to walk her home. Allyson rejects his advances and Oscar lags behind, spotting Michael watching him. Oscar tries to escape, but is caught on a fence and Michael impales him. Allyson turns back and finds Oscar's body and is chased by Michael before finding refuge in a neighboring home. Karen and Ray arrive at Laurie's fortified home and wait for Allyson to arrive.||||| Hawkins encounters Dr. Sartain and in turn, find Allyson during their search for Michael. Finding Michael, Hawkins runs him over with the police SUV and gets out of the vehicle to shoot Michael at point-blank range, despite Dr. Sartain's protests. Dr. Sartain stabs Hawkins in the throat with a blade hidden inside of a pen and kills him before taking Michael's mask and trying it on. Dr. Sartain loads Michael into the back of the vehicle with Allyson and drives to Laurie's house, intent on reuniting them. Michael regains consciousness and reclaims his mask, and Allyson informs Dr. Sartain that Michael spoke to her; distracted by demanding to know what Michael said, Michael breaks through the security barrier, forces Dr. Sartain out of the vehicle, and stomps on his head as Allyson flees on foot.||||| Ray steps outside to offer coffee to the police officers stationed outside Laurie's house and finds them dead. Michael appears behind Ray and strangles him. Laurie alerts Karen to Michael's arrival and sends her into the hidden safe room as she locks and barricades the front door. Michael breaks through the glass panels in the door and attacks Laurie, who escapes by shooting Michael's hand with a shotgun, stripping him of two fingers, forcing him to retreat. Laurie patrols her house room by room and seals each room off with security gates. Laurie encounters Michael upstairs; Allyson arrives as Laurie and Michael stab each other and witnesses Laurie fall from the balcony.||||| When she investigates, Laurie is gone and Allyson makes her way into the safe room with Karen, who alerts Michael. As he appears, Karen shoots him with a rifle and stuns him. Laurie appears from the shadows and attacks Michael, sending him tumbling down the steps into the safe room. Karen and Allyson leave the safe room, but Michael regains consciousness and grabs Karen's ankle. Allyson stabs Michael with his own knife and the two escape the room. Laurie flips a switch and metal bars spring into place, barricading the exit and trapping Michael in the safe room as it fills with gas. Laurie lights a flare and tosses it through the bars, setting the room ablaze with Michael in it. Laurie, Karen, and Allyson escape as the house is engulfed in flames and hitch a ride in the back of a pickup truck coming down the road.

Zordon informs the team that due to a galactic imbalance caused by the upcoming alignment the planets in the Solar System, he will be forced to temporarily lose his powers, leaving Alpha 5 in charge. After the Rangers teleport back to Angel Grove, Alpha expresses his sadness on being alone in \" this big, scary Command Center \". Meanwhile, Lord Zedd senses the sudden flux in energy. Realizing Zordon's powers are down, he transforms Zack's gorilla costume into Primator, which possesses the power to shape-shift into the likeness of any of the Power Rangers, either morphed or unmorphed.||||| Back at the Command Center, a bored Alpha 5 is scanning the Viewing Globe when he sees a little boy, Dylan, who needs help in the park.

Michonne brings all the leaders from the communities to apologize for Alexandria forgoing its relationships, that Alexandria will give asylum to Lydia, and to establish a mutual protection pact knowing that Alpha will likely retaliate. To affirm the pact, Ezekiel has the communities sign Michonne's charter and then starts arranging for a small combined force to travel to the Hilltop to make sure it is secure from an attack from the Whisperers.

Outside the theater, Alpha tries to convince Lydia to come with her, but Lydia rejects her. Alpha tells her she is not strong and no longer part of her group, and departs. Earlier that day, Daryl's small force leave for the Hilltop and meet up with the Highwaymen en route. The Highwaymen point them to a group of Hilltop residents that were killed by Alpha.

After announcing that her daughter is no longer a concern, Alpha takes out a shotgun and tells Daryl to come with her alone. At dawn, Alpha forces Daryl to the top of a cliff where a gargantuan horde of walkers and Whisperers walk beneath them.

{"Prompt": "Suppose you are a story-reteller, generate a list of main concepts to help me understand the story.\n\nStory: It's only been a few months since officer Durai Singam arrested Danny, and Singam is called into Vishakapatnam, Andra Pradesh by it's Home Minister to solve the long pending murder case of Commissioner Ramakrishna as the new Deputy Commissioner of Police. When Singam arrives in Vizag he's attacked at the train station by the goon Gun Ravi, who works for Vizag's most powerful don and buisness owner Madasudhana Reddy. Singam defeats Ravi's men and Ravi is scolded by Reddy for assaulting a police officer unnecessarily.||||| Singam heads to Vizag's police station and meets Inspector Subbo Rao, officer Srinivas, and Constable Veeram. Veeram used to live in Thoothikudi and is a big fan of Singam, confirming that Bhai and Danny are currently in prison while Thangaraj has been killed. Veeram asks Singam about his marriage but the other officers are confused since he stated he was unmarried. Singam tells Veeram that he and his wife Kavya are divorced, which is later revealed as a cover to keep her protected. Kavya also visits the station and Singam pretends not to no her. Singam is also visited by Vidya, a fangirl who asks for his autograph at the train station. When Vidya makes frequent visits to Singam it bugs him and he dismisses her. Veeram and Vidya become friends in their common interests.||||| Reddy calls his higher authority Vittal Prasad, a buisnessman stationed in Sydney, Australia who ships wastage from medical and electronic companies in exchange for free steal supplies for his company Vittal Steals. Vittal confronts his friend Steve for signing an oppositional agreement against him and beats up his wife in retaliation. Vittal calls his father, the Aviation Minister Ram Prasad to investigate Durai Singam when he gets update of his presence by Reddy. Back in Vizag, Singam fights a group of Reddy's men who threaten a custom's officer for blocking Reddy's shipment containers from Australia.||||| Singam calls Reddy himself and covers the attack claiming to be his secret ally, and begins to investigate the case and inquires Ramakrishna's family. The commissioner's wife states that he attended a murder call and was killed on that night. She sends Singam away when he tries to talk to her daughters, stating that Krisharaj, the assistant commissioner touched them innappropriatly when he came to inquire. Krishnaraj also told Singam earlier that he had no knowledge of Ramakrishna calling him. A confused Singam hires a hacker named Murili to hack into the cell company's network and find that a call took place for a few seconds during the Commissioner's murder to a man named Mallaya. Vidya later pays visit to Singam claiming to be a student for a police academy and simply wishes to learn from him.||||| A constable in the station falls sick mysteriously. After investigation, Singam, Subbo, and Srinivas find that the medicine tablet was sold without a permit under Reddy's authority and that the medicine originates from Australia. Singam pays visit to Bheemli Selvam, one of Reddy's men who authorized the attack at the train station. Suspecting him of murdering the Commissioner Singam searches his house and finds Australian money and a firearm. Reddy calls Singam and assures him that Selvam is permitted to have them. Vittal is also informed of the arrest by Rajeev Krishna, who works with Reddy and owns Vizag Scraps company.||||| Veeram and Srinivas show Singam an article written about him being a corrupt extortionist threatening Reddy, written by an author Agni who's revealed to be Vidya. Vidya is actually a journalist hired to write a thrilling story in Vizag and she chooses to portray Singam as such. Singam's family and Home Minister Ramnathan are confused by the article and Reddy suggests to Singam to keep his head down. Singam is called and informed that the same people who killed the commissioner also murdered security guards around the same time as found by a forensic officer. Singam pays visit to Mallaya, Ramakrishna's driver who confirms that Reddy baited Ramakrishna to the harbor and shot him. He never told anyone since he was caught and threatened with death to him and his family. Murili also confirms that the phone company had the call history on that night erased. Singam deduces that somebody other than Reddy helped him murder the commissioner.||||| The next day, Singam sends the entire force of Vizag to arrest every suspected criminal in the city including a great deal of Reddy's men. After shooting Selvam, Vidya begins to regret writing about Singam in the way she did. Reddy initially tolerates Singam's arrests but becomes suspicious when he takes too many of his men. Singam also confronts inspector Prakash and Krishnaraj who were involved in covering Ramakrishna's murder. Reddy calls Singam about his activity in which he reveals his true intentions. Singam later confronts Vidya for tricking him and has her arrested to pay a fine. She decides to leave Singam be afterwards. The police also identify the unnamed visitor to the station a few days ago from the funeral footage, as a local school teacher.||||| Singam interrogates the teacher, who confirms that he knows of the cause. Weeks before Ramakrishna was killed, his grandchildren as well as 32 students died from a smog attack from the local dump which was burning trash. Singam heads to the city dumps and finds Australian medicine, hospital wastage and electronic components. Singam puts the events that have passed together and realizes that Reddy makes living off of importing Australian waste into Vizag and has killed Ramakrishna to protect it, and deduces that Reddy is working with someone in Australia to help him. Reddy, Rajeev, and Vittal all find out about his revelation and Reddy sends Ravi to kill Singam and the school teacher. Singam arrives at the harbor to inspect the wastage containers and is ambushed by Reddy's men. Ravi kills the teacher and Singam arrives to late. Vittal calls him anonymously with Reddy and Rajeev on the line and threatens to kill Singam's family if he continues with the case.||||| The next day Singam decides he must get to the bottom of who Reddy's boss is. He starts with chasing down and arresting Ravi. He barges into Reddy's house and arrests him for all that he's done but he's only sentenced to two weeks of prison. Singam is also given permission to visit Australia to find Reddy's boss. He sends a drone into a steal company to find out who runs the buisness and confirms that Vittal is the man by searching Reddy's phone contacts.||||| He books an appointment with Vittal pretending he doesn't know who he really is and tells him straight to his face that he'll find the man who threatened his family. Singam leaves Australia immediatly and Vittal fails to capture him. When Singam returns he finds Reddy paroled for Ramakrishna's murder when three of his goons claim to be responsible and that their supposed motivation was Ramakrishna attempting to rape one of their wives. Singam is disgusted by Reddy's action and is threatened by Reddy that he'll take his job and his life. Singam is also suspended by the CBI for speaking out of turn when they critisize him for being an extortionist and for his visit to Australia to confront Vittal. Additionally, Ramakrishna's wife blames him for her husband's defaming.||||| Singam works to clean up the mess and continue to arrest wrongdoers on Reddy's part and campaigns against Reddy's influence and corruption in Vizag, including arresting the goons who paroled him. Singam frames Reddy for attempted assault on his own men and sends him on the run. When Singam tells Kavya that he can't let go of the case yet and Veeram finds out that Singam is still married. Vittal gets wind of Singam's rise in power and heads to India to confront him. Vittal tells Singam to stay out of his way, and Singam responds by intercepting Reddy and having Subbu shoot him since Reddy started a riot in Ram Prasad's favor six years earlier, which killed Subbu's son.||||| Singam reveals Vittal's containers to the press and threatens to give all evidence away to the public if Vittal doesn't pay him visit. Singam angrily scolds Vittal on how his buisness has hurt people but decides to give him another chance for his employee's sake. Vittal leaves humiliated and gathers Reddy's remaining men to retaliate. At an unknown point, he dumps 400 more containers of garbage into the state's coast. Vidya attempts to make amends for her actions and help Singam with his case by interviewing Vittal while Singam visits Thoothikudi with Kayva to attend her grandmother's funeral. Singam is followed by Rajeev who's on the same flight and arrests him. In exchange for Rajeev's release, Vittal captures and drugs Vidya. Singam sends Rajeev by car to Vizag and keeps his cell location stationed in Thoothikudi with Murlili's help.||||| Singam finds a vehicle belonging to Vittal's men and traces it to a hospital. Singam rescues Vidya who has to recover from a coma. On the way home that night, Vittal's men bomb Vizag station and attempt to kill Singam, injuring Srinivas who is sent to the hospital. The last straw, Singam finds government authorities and shows them all the evidence and events connecting Reddy, Vittal, and the wastage imports. Overriding influence of the ministers including Ram Prasad, Singam gets an arrest warrant and goes after Vittal who's on the run. Murili traces Vittal by cell signal to a highway leading to Telengara. Singam chases Vittal, who has escorts on the road while riding a container truck. Vittal gets past security in the airport despite having his passport blocked. Singam stops the plane to Malaysia from taking off. He arrests Vittal in the plane and takes him into custody. Vittal escapes into a nearby forest where Singam fights and shoots him dead. Srinivas and Vidya recover in the aftermath and Ram Prasad is fired.

Singam is disgusted by Reddy's action and is threatened by Reddy that he'll take his job and his life. Singam is also suspended by the CBI for speaking out of turn when they critisize him for being an extortionist and for his visit to Australia to confront Vittal. Additionally, Ramakrishna's wife blames him for her husband's defaming.||||| Singam works to clean up the mess and continue to arrest wrongdoers on Reddy's part and campaigns against Reddy's influence and corruption in Vizag, including arresting the goons who paroled him. Singam frames Reddy for attempted assault on his own men and sends him on the run. When Singam tells Kavya that he can't let go of the case yet and Veeram finds out that Singam is still married. Vittal gets wind of Singam's rise in power and heads to India to confront him. Vittal tells Singam to stay out of his way, and Singam responds by intercepting Reddy and having Subbu shoot him since Reddy started a riot in Ram Prasad's favor six years earlier, which killed Subbu's son.||||| Singam reveals Vittal's containers to the press and threatens to give all evidence away to the public if Vittal doesn't pay him visit. Singam angrily scolds Vittal on how his buisness has hurt people but decides to give him another chance for his employee's sake. Vittal leaves humiliated and gathers Reddy's remaining men to retaliate. At an unknown point, he dumps 400 more containers of garbage into the state's coast. Vidya attempts to make amends for her actions and help Singam with his case by interviewing Vittal while Singam visits Thoothikudi with Kayva to attend her grandmother's funeral. Singam is followed by Rajeev who's on the same flight and arrests him. In exchange for Rajeev's release, Vittal captures and drugs Vidya. Singam sends Rajeev by car to Vizag and keeps his cell location stationed in Thoothikudi with Murlili's help.||||| Singam finds a vehicle belonging to Vittal's men and traces it to a hospital. Singam rescues Vidya who has to recover from a coma. On the way home that night, Vittal's men bomb Vizag station and attempt to kill Singam, injuring Srinivas who is sent to the hospital. The last straw, Singam finds government authorities and shows them all the evidence and events connecting Reddy, Vittal, and the wastage imports. Overriding influence of the ministers including Ram Prasad, Singam gets an arrest warrant and goes after Vittal who's on the run. Murili traces Vittal by cell signal to a highway leading to Telengara. Singam chases Vittal, who has escorts on the road while riding a container truck. Vittal gets past security in the airport despite having his passport blocked. Singam stops the plane to Malaysia from taking off. He arrests Vittal in the plane and takes him into custody. Vittal escapes into a nearby forest where Singam fights and shoots him dead. Srinivas and Vidya recover in the aftermath and Ram Prasad is fired.

As high school senior Bianca Piper (Mae Whitman) explains, now jocks play video games, the princesses are on anti-depressants, and the nerds are in charge. We then see the short, slightly-overweight unattractive Bianca walking down the halls with her two attractive best friends: Jessica 'Jess' Harris (Skyler Samuels), an aspiring fashion designer, and Casey Cordero (Bianca A. Santos), a tough computer hacker girl. All the guys drool over Jess and Casey, but nobody ever really acknowledges Bianca. The school's ruthless mean-girl queen bee Madison Morgan (Bella Thorne) invites Jess and Casey to a party at her house, and deliberately chooses not to invite Bianca, until Casey makes it so that there's a free invitation. Here, we also meet Bianca's neighbor and former friend Wesley Rush (Robbie Amell), captain of the football team and Madison's on/off boyfriend. Bianca also has a crush on a guy named Toby Tucker (Nick Eversman), but she is too scared to say more than two words to him.||||| The supervisor of the school newspaper and Bianca's teacher, Mr. Arthur (Ken Jeong), assigns her the task of writing an article for the school newspaper on the upcoming homecoming dance and what social life means to her. She reluctantly agrees to it. At home, we meet Bianca's mom Dottie (Allison Janney), who became a successful author after her divorce. She was inspired by an episode of \"The Simpsons\" to create a book on the five stages of dealing with divorce.||||| She, along with Jess and Casey, convince Bianca to go to the party, despite her hesitance. At the party, Wes runs into Bianca and asks her if Jess and Casey have mentioned him or are interested in him. Bianca says it's not her job to divulge information on her friends, to which Wes argues that it is as their DUFF. Wes explains to a confused Bianca that it stands for the \"Designated Ugly Fat Friend\", and that a DUFF is there to make their friends look better by comparison. They are approachable enough for someone to ask them about their hot friends, and Bianca fits this role. Offended, she throws her drink in Wes's face. She goes home alone feeling insecure and self-conscious.||||| Throughout the rest of the day, the thought of being a DUFF bugs Bianca until she realizes that everyone only talks to her to get closer to Jess and Casey. She even notices all the other social cliques at school with their own DUFF. It gets to a point where Bianca confronts Jess and Casey about being their DUFF. Despite their assurance that they don't see her like that, Bianca spitefully unfollows them from every form of social media (Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Vine, etc.) and decides she doesn't want to be friends with them at all.

{"Prompt": "Suppose you are a story-reteller, generate a list of main concepts to help me understand the story.\n\nStory: The opening scene depicts Anita \"Needy\" Lesnicky (Amanda Seyfriend), a violent inmate in a correctional facility. She is notorious for being a 'kicker', and is now reflecting during lockdown on past events. Needy is a nerdy, substantially unpopular, \"plain Jane\" type student from Devil's Kettle, Minnesota, who has been best friends with Jennifer Check (Megan Fox), a beautiful, popular cheerleader, since their childhood. Needy's feelings toward Jennifer border on attraction. One evening, Jennifer has Needy accompany her to Melody Lane, a local bar, where an indie rock band named Low Shoulder is playing.||||| It seems unlikely that they would bother to perform in such a small town, but frontman Nikolai Wolf (Adam Brody) explains that it is a service to their fans. As Jennifer is fetching them drinks (getting past the age restriction barrier by flirting with the bartender), Needy overhears Nikolai referring to her as the \"State Fair Butter Queen\" - she loves to flirt and act promiscuously, but is in truth a virgin. During the performance, the bar catches on fire. Nikolai gazes on with a smirk, and Needy leads Jennifer to safety through the toilet window, just barely escaping from being killed in the blaze. Outside, they are accosted by the band, who made it out okay. Jennifer is in shock and Nikolai offers to lead them to \"somewhere safe\" in his van. Jennifer agrees in spite of Needy's protests and leaves with the band. Needy watches as the remains of the bar collapses to the ground.||||| Needy eventually makes it home where she finds a note from her divorced mother, stating that she is working swing shift this evening. Needy calls her boyfriend Chip (Johnny Simmons) to tell him what happened, and expresses her concern for Jennifer's safety. A bruised, bleeding Jennifer suddenly appears in Needy's home with torn clothing. Things get even stranger as Needy watches Jennifer tear wolfishly into a raw chicken in her fridge and monstrously roar at her, before spewing up a black, tar-like substance all over the floor. Jennifer further terrorizes Needy when she throws her against a wall and asks if she is scared of her. Jennifer then runs out the front door leaving a bewildered and frightened Needy behind.||||| The next day, the whole town mourns the tragedy of the bar fire, and Needy morosely remembers her childhood friend. Jennifer arrives at school acting as if nothing is wrong, and is completely unsympathetic to the victims of the fire. Jennifer meets up with the high school football captain, grieving the death of his best friend at the hands of the fire. She says his late friend suggested that they would have made a \"banging\" couple and leads him into the woods to ostensibly fulfill that request. As the two are kissing, her mouth transforms into a demonic gaping maw and she attacks him. Later that day, a highly-concerned teacher at the school finds the captain's grisly remains, and the town is rocked by the additional tragedy. Low Shoulder's song \"Through the Trees\" becomes a smashing success, and they donate 3% of their earnings to the cause of the victims. Needy questions the paltry effort, and wonders why they are credited with having rescued survivors while she herself knows that that is untrue.||||| A month passes by and Jennifer begins to look a little pale and gaunt, enigmatically explaining that \"it is wearing off\" and that she needs sustenance. Jennifer catches the eye of the school nerd Colin Gray (Kyle Gallner), and asks him to meet her at her house, though later making rude remarks to Needy about Colin's femininity and taste in music.||||| The next evening, Needy spends time with Chip, while Colin goes to meet Jennifer only to find that she has directed him to a still-in-construction house in a deserted neighborhood where she is in an upstairs room lit by various candles. Jennifer suddenly transforms into a snake-eyed humanoid creature, kills Colin, and sups on his flesh, as Needy has a vision of Jennifer that causes her to panic as Chip makes love to her. Needy drives home from Chip's house only to encounter Jennifer walking like an animal across the road before jumping onto her car's windshield. Needy returns home, only to find Jennifer sleeping in her bed and wearing one of Needy's shirts. They begin to passionately kiss until Needy snaps and demands to know what's happening. Needy orders Jennifer to leave, but Jennifer instead confesses what happened to her on the night the local bar burned down.||||| In a flashback sequence, Low Shoulder drove Jennifer out into a forested area, gleefully intending to offer her as a Satanic sacrifice in exchange for chart success. During the band's discussions, several wondered if Jennifer really was a virgin, which she insisted she was in the hopes that they would let her go. Using some instructions they downloaded off the internet, they spoke an incantation to the Devil, before stabbing her with a Bowie knife, which was then thrown into the notorious whirlpool off the nearby Devil's Kettle Falls.||||| Back in the present, Jennifer further explains to Needy that she found herself still alive (which Needy doubts), and then wandered away from the site after they had left, which is when Jennifer stumbled back to Needy's place that night. Jennifer also confides to Needy that when she is fully replenished with human flesh, she is indestructible. She demonstrates this by stabbing herself in the arm with a pocket knife, which immediately heals. Jennifer also tells Needy that on that same night, she came across the Indian exchange student that had survived the fire walking along the road, and devoured him and hid his body in the woods. Needy threatens to call the police, but Jennifer tells Needy that she will just deny everything and that no one will ever believe such a story. With that, Jennifer jumps out of Needy's second floor window and lands on the ground, completely uninjured, and runs off into the night.||||| Now more worried than ever, Needy goes to the occult section of their school's library and begins to do research. Needy soon finds where the band went wrong. Because Jennifer wasn't actually means a virgin, their sacrifice backfired - though it indeed brought them prosperity, it also turned Jennifer into a succubus, a female demon with a constant need to feed on young men to keep herself in good health. Needy realizes that the Spring Formal is approaching and that Jennifer could very well turn the dance into a bloodbath. She informs Chip about this and warns him not to attend the Formal, but he simply suggests that she get psychiatric help.||||| She breaks up with him in order to protect him, and he decides to attend in lieu of her warnings. The Spring Formal finally arrives, attended by Low Shoulder, who are now incredibly popular and have sold out a national tour. As they take the stage, Needy does not see Chip anywhere, so she leaves in pursuit of him. In the meanwhile, Jennifer confronts Chip in the woods, telling him that Needy was having an affair with Colin and that that was why she was so upset when the latter passed. Despite Chip affirming that he loves Needy, Jennifer kisses him ardently in an attempt to seduce him. She leads him to an abandoned mansion with a graffiti-filled indoor swimming pool. She kisses him again, but he rejects her yet again, causing her to throw him into the gunky water in a fit of rage.||||| Needy rushes towards the mansion to find a demonic, animalistic Jennifer and an injured Chip, still in the pool and suffering extensive blood loss due to Jennifer already having bitten him. Needy dives into the water to help Chip and maces Jennifer, causing her to vomit more black fluid. As Needy and Chip crawl out of the dirty swimming pool, Jennifer levitates above them. Needy confronts Jennifer about how she was never a good friend to her, and Jennifer threatens to kill her. Chip, uses the last of his energy to impale Jennifer through the stomach with a pool net's handle, before she escapes through a nearby window. Needy tries to call for help using Chip's phone, but it is damaged from being in the water. He dies in her arms, but not before the two profess their mutual love.||||| Needy wails as she mourns him. Needy, hell-bent on revenge, breaks into Jennifer's room, where she and her former best friend scuffle. Needy eventually yanks the \"Best Friends Forever\" locket from her former friend's neck and kills her by stabbing her through the heart with a box cutter. Jennifer's mother (Carrie Genzel) hears the noise and enters the bedroom to find Needy crouched over her daughter with the bloody knife. This results in Needy being taken to a mental institution. However, due to having been bitten by Jennifer during their fight, Needy has developed some demonic powers of her own, as well as Jennifer's evil personality - she has become vicious, ill-tempered, and anti-social with the orderlies and other residents. Isolated and abandoned by everyone she knows, she sets a plot in motion to escape. After a fight with an institution doctor, Needy is isolated in a cell. That night, she levitates herself to an overhead window, kicks it out with her superhuman strength, breaks through a nearby chain-link fence, and escapes into the night.||||| As she wanders down a rural road, she finds a watery runoff (which is where the nearby Devil Falls empties out into), along with the knife that Low Shoulder used to stab Jennifer, which she picks up. She flags down a passing vehicle and tells the driver she's following a band. The man exclaims that they must \"be one hell of a group,\" to which she then grimly explains that \"tonight's gonna be their last show.\" The end credits show Low Shoulder checking into a hotel post-concert and candidly indulging in drugs and alcohol in their hotel room. Eventually, the band is savagely murdered by a blurred figure. We then see police crime scene photos of the band members' corpses strewn around the hotel room, Nikolai having been stabbed in the chest with the sacrificial knife. The final image of the movie shows security camera footage of an evil-looking Needy walking down the hotel hallway past a gathering of female band groupies.\n\n \n", "original_narrative": "The opening scene depicts Anita \"Needy\" Lesnicky (Amanda Seyfriend), a violent inmate in a correctional facility.

Low Shoulder's song \"Through the Trees\" becomes a smashing success, and they donate 3% of their earnings to the cause of the victims. Needy questions the paltry effort, and wonders why they are credited with having rescued survivors while she herself knows that that is untrue.||||| A month passes by and Jennifer begins to look a little pale and gaunt, enigmatically explaining that \"it is wearing off\" and that she needs sustenance. Jennifer catches the eye of the school nerd Colin Gray (Kyle Gallner), and asks him to meet her at her house, though later making rude remarks to Needy about Colin's femininity and taste in music.||||| The next evening, Needy spends time with Chip, while Colin goes to meet Jennifer only to find that she has directed him to a still-in-construction house in a deserted neighborhood where she is in an upstairs room lit by various candles. Jennifer suddenly transforms into a snake-eyed humanoid creature, kills Colin, and sups on his flesh, as Needy has a vision of Jennifer that causes her to panic as Chip makes love to her. Needy drives home from Chip's house only to encounter Jennifer walking like an animal across the road before jumping onto her car's windshield. Needy returns home, only to find Jennifer sleeping in her bed and wearing one of Needy's shirts. They begin to passionately kiss until Needy snaps and demands to know what's happening. Needy orders Jennifer to leave, but Jennifer instead confesses what happened to her on the night the local bar burned down.||||| In a flashback sequence, Low Shoulder drove Jennifer out into a forested area, gleefully intending to offer her as a Satanic sacrifice in exchange for chart success. During the band's discussions, several wondered if Jennifer really was a virgin, which she insisted she was in the hopes that they would let her go. Using some instructions they downloaded off the internet, they spoke an incantation to the Devil, before stabbing her with a Bowie knife, which was then thrown into the notorious whirlpool off the nearby Devil's Kettle Falls.||||| Back in the present, Jennifer further explains to Needy that she found herself still alive (which Needy doubts), and then wandered away from the site after they had left, which is when Jennifer stumbled back to Needy's place that night. Jennifer also confides to Needy that when she is fully replenished with human flesh, she is indestructible. She demonstrates this by stabbing herself in the arm with a pocket knife, which immediately heals. Jennifer also tells Needy that on that same night, she came across the Indian exchange student that had survived the fire walking along the road, and devoured him and hid his body in the woods. Needy threatens to call the police, but Jennifer tells Needy that she will just deny everything and that no one will ever believe such a story. With that, Jennifer jumps out of Needy's second floor window and lands on the ground, completely uninjured, and runs off into the night.||||| Now more worried than ever, Needy goes to the occult section of their school's library and begins to do research. Needy soon finds where the band went wrong. Because Jennifer wasn't actually means a virgin, their sacrifice backfired - though it indeed brought them prosperity, it also turned Jennifer into a succubus, a female demon with a constant need to feed on young men to keep herself in good health. Needy realizes that the Spring Formal is approaching and that Jennifer could very well turn the dance into a bloodbath. She informs Chip about this and warns him not to attend the Formal, but he simply suggests that she get psychiatric help.||||| She breaks up with him in order to protect him, and he decides to attend in lieu of her warnings. The Spring Formal finally arrives, attended by Low Shoulder, who are now incredibly popular and have sold out a national tour. As they take the stage, Needy does not see Chip anywhere, so she leaves in pursuit of him. In the meanwhile, Jennifer confronts Chip in the woods, telling him that Needy was having an affair with Colin and that that was why she was so upset when the latter passed. Despite Chip affirming that he loves Needy, Jennifer kisses him ardently in an attempt to seduce him. She leads him to an abandoned mansion with a graffiti-filled indoor swimming pool. She kisses him again, but he rejects her yet again, causing her to throw him into the gunky water in a fit of rage.||||| Needy rushes towards the mansion to find a demonic, animalistic Jennifer and an injured Chip, still in the pool and suffering extensive blood loss due to Jennifer already having bitten him. Needy dives into the water to help Chip and maces Jennifer, causing her to vomit more black fluid. As Needy and Chip crawl out of the dirty swimming pool, Jennifer levitates above them. Needy confronts Jennifer about how she was never a good friend to her, and Jennifer threatens to kill her. Chip, uses the last of his energy to impale Jennifer through the stomach with a pool net's handle, before she escapes through a nearby window. Needy tries to call for help using Chip's phone, but it is damaged from being in the water. He dies in her arms, but not before the two profess their mutual love.||||| Needy wails as she mourns him. Needy, hell-bent on revenge, breaks into Jennifer's room, where she and her former best friend scuffle. Needy eventually yanks the \"Best Friends Forever\" locket from her former friend's neck and kills her by stabbing her through the heart with a box cutter. Jennifer's mother (Carrie Genzel) hears the noise and enters the bedroom to find Needy crouched over her daughter with the bloody knife. This results in Needy being taken to a mental institution. However, due to having been bitten by Jennifer during their fight, Needy has developed some demonic powers of her own, as well as Jennifer's evil personality - she has become vicious, ill-tempered, and anti-social with the orderlies and other residents. Isolated and abandoned by everyone she knows, she sets a plot in motion to escape. After a fight with an institution doctor, Needy is isolated in a cell. That night, she levitates herself to an overhead window, kicks it out with her superhuman strength, breaks through a nearby chain-link fence, and escapes into the night.||||| As she wanders down a rural road, she finds a watery runoff (which is where the nearby Devil Falls empties out into), along with the knife that Low Shoulder used to stab Jennifer, which she picks up. She flags down a passing vehicle and tells the driver she's following a band. The man exclaims that they must \"be one hell of a group,\" to which she then grimly explains that \"tonight's gonna be their last show.\" The end credits show Low Shoulder checking into a hotel post-concert and candidly indulging in drugs and alcohol in their hotel room. Eventually, the band is savagely murdered by a blurred figure. We then see police crime scene photos of the band members' corpses strewn around the hotel room, Nikolai having been stabbed in the chest with the sacrificial knife. The final image of the movie shows security camera footage of an evil-looking Needy walking down the hotel hallway past a gathering of female band groupies.", "row": 24, "response": "Here are the main concepts to help you understand the story:\n\n**Characters**\n\n1.

She discovers Odessa drinking Alejandro's good scotch, and now she's cut her hand; when she goes to get a first aid kit from Odessa's medical cabinet, she discovers cancer medication, now knowing that the reason her superior is drinking is to numb the pain of her disease.||||| When Alejandro finds the bottle broken, Carmen once again takes the blame and offers to clean it up; the next morning, Odessa discovers Carmen cleaning the silver, even though it's her job. She realizes that Carmen knows about the cancer and refuses to let her feel sorry for her, stating that she's not dead yet as she takes over the silver-polishing as always. Carmen knows from having seen her mother go through it that pain medication for cancer doesn't always work, and so she makes Odessa a brownie filled with medical marijuana. Carmen says that, while Odessa is right in thinking that she was only being nice to her because she was dying, she would like to know her. Odessa proceeds to reveal that she was once a great dancer before getting cancer in her leg and leaving Russia because she could not stand people feeling sorry for her. She and Carmen proceed to bond as she reads some of her old reviews.||||| The two undercover maids, Rosie and Marisol , proceed to meet up so that the former can reveal to the latter that she quit her job at the Powells'. Marisol is distraught because of how close they are to finding out who killed Flora , but Rosie doesn't like the way Evelyn acted with Tucker , having felt insane vibes from the woman. Marisol assures that Evelyn is fine, but Rosie senses that this is a lie, now being able to tell when Marisol is lying.||||| Marisol realizes that she's right; she says how she's been telling herself over and over that because she was trying to free Eddie then the ends justified the means, but now she's starting hurting people with her constant trickery and that's not right. Rosie later returns to Evelyn to get paid for the last of her work, and Evelyn gets her some money from the safe. As she does this, Rosie sees a DVD - Flora #10 - stashed away inside. Thinking this to be the one Marisol needs, she agrees to return as Evelyn's maid. She only saw the first two letters of the combination: BA; however, Marisol knows it to be BARRETT, since this is the name of someone Evelyn loved very very much. While Rosie succeeds at stealing the DVD, Evelyn continues to grow creepily attached to Tucker.", "row": 26, "response": "Here are the main concepts to help you understand the story:\n\n**Characters**\n\n1.

In a nod to their previous meeting, they wish each other a Merry Christmas and go their separate ways.

Back at the construction site, Frank tells Ed about a woman he met on the train that morning, and meanwhile at Isabelle's office, while showing her latest illustrations, Molly mentions Frank. Despite their friends's goading, Molly and Frank downplay any significance; however, prior to boarding the train, Frank practices a dialogue he might have with Molly. On the train, Frank sees Molly looking for a seat and later approaches her standing near the door where they have an awkward conversation about being married and the curious fact of running into each other again. Tactfully, Frank suggests that they ride together tomorrow, and, Molly tells him that she plans to take the Friday, 9:04am train. That morning, Frank just makes the train, and Molly saves the seat next to her.||||| During the ride, he talks about his sons. Later that day, Frank arranges to meet Molly at the hospital and persuades her to have lunch, during which he does most of the talking. Although shy, Molly is engaged by his conversation and sense of humor. On another day, at a cafe in Grand Central Station, Molly speaks more openly, revealing that two years ago her newborn daughter died. Molly and Frank continue to get to know each during their commutes. Sometime later, while walking together in Manhattan, Isabelle suspects that Molly is seeing someone, based on her glowing appearance. Molly tries to explain that it is only a friendship, but her uneasiness indicates deeper feelings. Embarrassed, Molly abruptly walks away from Isabelle and telephones Frank. Molly and Frank spend that afternoon in Chinatown and have their picture taken together in an arcade photo booth. That evening during dinner with Brian, Molly appears preoccupied.||||| On another day, Molly hurries to the hospital to learn that her father had an arteriogram, and requires heart surgery. Molly is unable to reach her husband with the news, so she telephones Frank and goes to see him at the construction site. Frank recognizes that something is wrong. At first, Molly explains that her father is back in the hospital, but then proclaims, with ambivalence, that she has responsibilities and should not see Frank anymore. As she gets into a taxi, Frank asks her to wait for him at the station cafe at 5:45pm, prior to boarding the train. Delayed by work, Frank hurries to the station, only to miss the rendezvous. As the train pulls away, he turns around to see that Molly is waiting for him on the platform. He passionately kisses her and expresses his love. The next day, instead of taking his sons to a baseball game, Frank meets Molly at Rizzoli.||||| Despite their mutual doubts and anxiety, they go to Ed's empty apartment in Manhattan. They kiss, but as they move to the bed and begin to remove their clothes, Molly says she cannot continue and apologizes. They hold hands on the train home. At the Dobbs Ferry station, Molly watches from the train as Frank's wife and sons greet him. When she arrives home, Molly's husband says her father has died, and Frank learns the news when he tries to telephone Molly at the hospital. Overcome with grief and guilt, Molly becomes hysterical during the funeral, and her husband has a difficult time calming her. At home in bed, she relates to Isabelle that she cannot stop thinking about Frank, and that Brian assumes Molly is just distracted by the death of her father. Molly admits to Isabelle that she loves Frank and believes they are meant to be together even though she is resigned to the fact that they never will be.||||| While Ann fixes him dinner, Frank discusses the Houston job that he has finally accepted, but his wife senses that there is something else he is not telling her. Frank confesses that he met a woman on the train, but that it was only a friendship and nothing happened. Calmly, Ann says that she will take the kids to Denver for two weeks to see her mother, and then she slaps Frank. That evening, Frank drives to Molly's house and looks at it from his car. The night of his departure for Houston, he telephones Molly at home and says he misses her, asking if they can meet that evening.||||| Molly's husband enters the room, making it difficult for her to talk openly, so she says goodbye, wishing Frank a good trip. After she hangs up, her husband says, \"well, that's that,\" indicating he knows about Frank. Molly rushes out to catch Frank, despite Brian's pleading. Frank calls Molly again before getting in the taxi, but Brian answers, lying to Frank that Molly does not want to speak to him. In the pouring rain, Molly speeds along the road, slamming on brakes to avoid a train and stalling her car, thereby missing the opportunity to say goodbye. The following Christmas, Frank is visiting from Houston and meets Ed at a restaurant in Manhattan.||||| After Ed asks Frank to be the best man at his upcoming wedding, Frank reveals that he came back to arrange the sale of his house and that his marriage with Ann did not work out, so she returned to Denver. Meanwhile, Molly is also in Manhattan visiting with Isabelle, who encourages Molly to accept a job offer and insists that she should join her in Barbados, instead of spending Christmas alone. That evening, Frank enters Rizzoli and encounters Molly. During their polite but reserved exchange, Molly apologizes for not being able to say goodbye the night he left for Houston, and Frank says he should not have called. When asked about their families, neither discloses the state of their marriages. They wish each other a Merry Christmas and leave the bookstore, walking in opposite directions, but thinking about the other. Frank stops and runs down the sidewalk. At Grand Central Station, Molly boards the commuter train. During the journey, she sees Frank making his way towards her.

At first, Molly explains that her father is back in the hospital, but then proclaims, with ambivalence, that she has responsibilities and should not see Frank anymore. As she gets into a taxi, Frank asks her to wait for him at the station cafe at 5:45pm, prior to boarding the train. Delayed by work, Frank hurries to the station, only to miss the rendezvous. As the train pulls away, he turns around to see that Molly is waiting for him on the platform. He passionately kisses her and expresses his love. The next day, instead of taking his sons to a baseball game, Frank meets Molly at Rizzoli.||||| Despite their mutual doubts and anxiety, they go to Ed's empty apartment in Manhattan. They kiss, but as they move to the bed and begin to remove their clothes, Molly says she cannot continue and apologizes. They hold hands on the train home. At the Dobbs Ferry station, Molly watches from the train as Frank's wife and sons greet him. When she arrives home, Molly's husband says her father has died, and Frank learns the news when he tries to telephone Molly at the hospital. Overcome with grief and guilt, Molly becomes hysterical during the funeral, and her husband has a difficult time calming her. At home in bed, she relates to Isabelle that she cannot stop thinking about Frank, and that Brian assumes Molly is just distracted by the death of her father. Molly admits to Isabelle that she loves Frank and believes they are meant to be together even though she is resigned to the fact that they never will be.||||| While Ann fixes him dinner, Frank discusses the Houston job that he has finally accepted, but his wife senses that there is something else he is not telling her. Frank confesses that he met a woman on the train, but that it was only a friendship and nothing happened. Calmly, Ann says that she will take the kids to Denver for two weeks to see her mother, and then she slaps Frank. That evening, Frank drives to Molly's house and looks at it from his car. The night of his departure for Houston, he telephones Molly at home and says he misses her, asking if they can meet that evening.||||| Molly's husband enters the room, making it difficult for her to talk openly, so she says goodbye, wishing Frank a good trip. After she hangs up, her husband says, \"well, that's that,\" indicating he knows about Frank. Molly rushes out to catch Frank, despite Brian's pleading. Frank calls Molly again before getting in the taxi, but Brian answers, lying to Frank that Molly does not want to speak to him. In the pouring rain, Molly speeds along the road, slamming on brakes to avoid a train and stalling her car, thereby missing the opportunity to say goodbye. The following Christmas, Frank is visiting from Houston and meets Ed at a restaurant in Manhattan.||||| After Ed asks Frank to be the best man at his upcoming wedding, Frank reveals that he came back to arrange the sale of his house and that his marriage with Ann did not work out, so she returned to Denver. Meanwhile, Molly is also in Manhattan visiting with Isabelle, who encourages Molly to accept a job offer and insists that she should join her in Barbados, instead of spending Christmas alone. That evening, Frank enters Rizzoli and encounters Molly. During their polite but reserved exchange, Molly apologizes for not being able to say goodbye the night he left for Houston, and Frank says he should not have called. When asked about their families, neither discloses the state of their marriages. They wish each other a Merry Christmas and leave the bookstore, walking in opposite directions, but thinking about the other. Frank stops and runs down the sidewalk. At Grand Central Station, Molly boards the commuter train. During the journey, she sees Frank making his way towards her.

Neal and Mozzie meet with Teddy. They bring along the Rolexes. Peter and Jones bust the \"deal\" and Neal pretends to help Teddy beat the search. Teddy now owes him one and says the last he knew Alex was headed to the Conservatory garden. Security tapes indicate Alex disappeared in the garden. Peter and Neal re-trace her steps in the garden. They lose track of each other. Back at the entrance, Peter gets a call. It's Adler telling him to get into a limo that now contains Neal.

Philip discovers that Dupont Circle Travel has lost Jeremy , an important client of 15 years, to a budget travel agency. Elizabeth leaves the tour group and changes into her \"Meaghan\" disguise. However, the tour guide notices she's missing and calls security. Philip talks with Stavos about losing Jeremy which Stavos blames on Jeremy being Philip's client and him being too busy to handle him anymore. Meeting McCleesh in the cafeteria, Elizabeth sees security looking for her but she's able to convince McCleesh to go outside to eat. McCleesh discloses that Ronald Reagan is going senile. Elizabeth tells Claudia about Reagan. Paige arrives and as part of her on-going lessons on Russia, Claudia plays a Tchaikovsky record for her.||||| ( Tchaikovsky - None but the Lonely Heart, Op. 6 ) The President might be going senile. Leaving Claudia's, Paige asks Elizabeth if the KGB ever uses sex to get information, which she read about in a book. Elizabeth lies and denies it's a standard technique but then hedges and says it may happen in rare occasions when one gets close to a source or the information is important enough. With Paige and Marilyn again running counter-surveillance, in disguise, Elizabeth meets with Rennhull. He doesn't have the sensor and reminds her that their contact six years before resulted in the death of Sanford Prince . He refuses to get it so Elizabeth pushes hard and blackmails him. She gives him a new time and place to meet and leaves. At the Haskard's, Elizabeth photographs Glenn's documents he's prepared for the summit.||||| While tending to Erica, who is in pain, Erica makes Elizabeth start drawing. Philip calls Henry at St. Edward's while working late at the agency. Philip talks about losing Jeremy and Henry agrees with Stavos that Philip should have handled Jeremy. It says that sex is one of the techniques. Meeting with Rennhull for a third time with Paige and Marilyn again running counter-surveillance, he immediately pulls a gun on Elizabeth. Even after threatening that the KGB will kill him if he shoots, Rennhull says he's not going to betray his country nor face going to jail by being blackmailed. Begging for her life, Elizabeth kneels and is able to jump into Rennhull under his pistol's line of fire. They struggle, Elizabeth jumps on top of him and wrestles the gun under Rennhull's jaw. It goes off, killing Rennhull and splattering blood and brains all over Elizabeth's face. Hearing the shot, Paige breaks surveillance and runs out of her car.

Peter triggers Walter's device, killing Jones by sealing the doorway.||||| At the end of the episode, Walter again goes alone to visit the graveyard; he tearfully observes a gravestone marked \"Peter Bishop 1978-1985\", suggesting that Walter's legitimate son died.

The paramedic pulls back the sheet to show it's Nina Sharp ( Blair Brown ). At FBI HQ in Boston Charlie ( Kirk Acevedo ), Broyles ( Lance Reddick ) and Olivia ( Anna Torv ) watch the security footage from Nina's building. There are three of them, wearing masks. They shoot her in the elevator then the tape cuts out for four minutes. They try to match the voice. David Robert Jones ( Jared Harris ), the ZFT mastermind. He says \"take out the camera, we can do it here.\" Olivia wants to bring William Bell ( Leonard Nimoy ) in. Broyles gently chastises her for assuming he doesn't agree. He's on board. Nina Sharp is out of surgery. Peter ( Joshua Jackson ) comes in to the lab. Walter ( John Noble ) didn't come home last night. Peter calls someone about Walter. Astrid ( Jasika Nicole ) can't find him either. Peter tells Olivia he understands why she had to say what she did. He's not worried about him.||||| Walter visits a grave, The Observer ( Michael Cerveris ) watches. Nina wakes up. Her electronic hand is on the fritz. Broyles is at her bedside. He asks her what Jones wanted with her arm. Nina asks for Olivia. Jones walks down a street carrying a briefcase, face partially bandaged. Olivia comes to Nina's room where specialists from Massive Dynamic are working on her. Jones and his crew start setting something up in the middle of a busy street. Nina tells Olivia that Jones worked for Bell 15 years ago but Bell isn't a terrorist. She says Jones was fired and was bitter about it since William was a father figure to him. She said after Jones busted out of prison he started calling for Bell a lot. Broyles tells Olivia that Nina thinks Jones wants to kill Bell. But she doesn't know where he is. She hasn't seen Bell for months. She thinks speaking to Bell has become more than a professional matter. She's counting on it. If Olivia can get to Jones first, she can talk to Bell.||||| Olivia asks what Jones did to Nina in the elevator after she was shot. Holding her bionic arm, she says Jones stole a very powerful energy cell Bell hid there. Jones delicately takes a small object out of a case and fits it into his machine. Through his bandages his face is bubbly and gross. The machine starts emitting a high pitched whine. People on the street start holding their ears. They increase the frequency. As Jones turns some knobs a whirring energy field appears in the street, like some sort of wormhole. Jones' men tell him they can't hold it open and it shuts, cutting off the back half of a truck that passed through. Jones says they're the wrong coordinates and they need to try again. When he removes his sunglasses we can see one of his eyes is now blue. Walter and The Observer walk along a beach. The Observer asks Walter if he recognizes a coin he's holding. Walter asks him how he got it. He says it looks similar to one Walter is thinking of, but it's different. \"There's more than one of everything,\" he says.||||| He asks him if the house they're in front of looks familiar and if he remembers what he has to find. He says there isn't much time. At Harvard, Broyles brings Nina into the lab. They ask her if Walter talked to anyone strange lately. Nina tells Peter that Jones has something Walter might know about. Nina calls someone for a search of Walter. Olivia and Charlie check out the half truck. Witnesses describe a curtain or window with a sheen that the truck came through. They describe a man in bandages. Nina shows Peter train security footage of his dad near a beach house they used to own. Peter wants to go up there himself. At the truck, Charlie gets a report the VIN and serial numbers don't exist and there's no record of it anywhere. Peter reaches the beach house. He looks around inside and finds Walter sitting by himself. He says he's looking for something. He's turning the coin over and over. He knows what he's looking for is important, but he can't remember what it is.||||| Olivia asks Nina where the truck came from. She asks where Bell is. She tells Nina to stop playing games or she'll turn this world over looking for him. Nina says that's the problem, he's not in this world. Providence, Rhode Island A black van pulls up to a kid's soccer game. Jones gets out. OIivia tries to talk Charlie through the idea Bell is in an alternate reality. That's why they can't ID the truck. It came from the other side. That's what Jones is using the energy cell for, to cross over to get to Bell. Their cell phones all ring. Walter searches frantically through the house, on the verge of a breakdown. Peter tries to calm him down, but he rails and thrashes and keeps searching. Peter tells his dad about fond memories of coming to the house as a kid, including Walter making pancakes. Walter gets excited when he remembers. He knows why he's there and where it is.||||| At the soccer field a kid describes a see-through wall that appeared, like a window. A kid ran into the shimmer and collapsed. They look at the body - it's cleanly sliced off. Charlie is ready to start buying the alternate reality theory. Olivia asks someone to run a check for all files mentioning science, biology or unexplained phenomena. All of them. She starts marking them on a map of New England with pushpins. She tells Broyles she thinks she found a connection and they need to call Nina. Walter opens a trunk in the beach house attic. He finds the box he was looking for with a coin just like the one The Observer gave him on top. It's a small tackle box, but it's locked. Olivia goes over the dots with Nina and Broyles. She marks the spots where Jones used his device. The other locations radiate out from them.||||| Walter opens the box and takes out a small object. He says when he and William were young they took copious amounts of LSD and became convinced they could experience alternate realities and some kids could see these alternate realities naturally. They theorized the subjects might be able to travel to alternate worlds. Around this time, Walter says, he lost something very dear to him. He thought he could find it over there. Nina explains finding the right place to cross over is the key. Bell proposed our world has \"soft spots,\" areas where the speed of light and protons have begun to decay, like the Bermuda Triangle, where it is easier to cross over. Their meddling with the laws of nature has increased the soft spots. She thinks Jones is looking for those. Walter continues the explanation, saying opening the hole could let things from there cross over to here, which could be dangerous. He built a plug, a patch to close the hole. That's what the object is. And he knows where the hole is: Reiden Lake.||||| Nina and Olivia want to try to predict the next soft spot. They trace the oldest incidents back to Reiden Lake. Jones and his men arrive at Reiden Lake. He tells them to set up the gear. \"Come on, men, we're going to the other side,\" he says. Peter drives Walter to the lake. Walter says they have to hurry, but he doesn't know why. He mentions his friend who visited him. Peter realizes he's talking about The Observer, the man who attacked him in the woods. Walter says Peter probably doesn't remember, but when he was very sick as a kid he began collecting coins to calm himself. He gives Peter the one he's been holding and says it was the coin. Peter doesn't remember it. Suddenly, their doors are opened and men grab them out of the car. Olivia runs over and calls off her agents. They're all there to plug a hole in the universe.||||| They see a bright light in the distance and run for it. Jones has got the machine going. He stays focused on it as his side starts trading gunfire with FBI agents. Walter gives Peter the patch to close the hole as Olivia creeps closer to Jones and the slowly opening universe hole. The hole opens up and Jones walks towards it. She shoots him. He keeps going. She shoots him again. He walks on. Looking oozy and gross, he tells her the teleporter may be killing him, but in the meantime it's made him something special. Bullets pass through him. He walks toward the opening. Olivia runs after him and Peter, holding the patch, runs after her. As Jones steps into the hole, Peter aims the patch at it, emitting a light. The hole closes shut, shearing Jones in half. Back at HQ Broyles tells OIivia that Nina sends her gratitude, but they've been told to cease and desist their investigation into William Bell.||||| Astrid arrives at the lab. She and Peter find a note, addressed to him. He reads it: \"Stepping out for a bit, don't worry about me, son, I know where I'm going.\" Peter tells Astrid not to call the police. It's the first time Walter's left a note. Walter stands back at the grave he visited earlier. He leaves the coin on it. It says: \"Peter Bishop, 1978-1985.\" Walter cries. Olivia's phone rings. It's Nina Sharp, summoning her to a hotel in Manhattan, planning to hold up her end of the bargain.||||| On her way there, through the city, Olivia is nearly hit by a speeding car. She makes it to the hotel as planned. She waits. She calls for Nina and is told Nina is out of the country. Olivia leaves. She rides the elevator down. She's alone. Then the lights flash and she's not, then she is again. The doors open on an all-white hallway. A woman greets her by name and shows her to an office. There is an oxygen tank and newspapers announcing Obama's victory. A man enters. \"I've been waiting quite a long time for this,\" he tells her. She asks where she is and who he is. The first part is complicated. The second is easy: He's William Bell. Olivia looks out the window. She's standing in one of the towers of the World Trade Center.\n\n \n", "original_narrative": "New York City A gunshot victim is brought into the ER. The paramedic pulls back the sheet to show it's Nina Sharp ( Blair Brown ). At FBI HQ in Boston Charlie ( Kirk Acevedo ), Broyles ( Lance Reddick ) and Olivia ( Anna Torv ) watch the security footage from Nina's building. There are three of them, wearing masks. They shoot her in the elevator then the tape cuts out for four minutes. They try to match the voice. David Robert Jones ( Jared Harris ), the ZFT mastermind. He says \"take out the camera, we can do it here.\" Olivia wants to bring William Bell ( Leonard Nimoy ) in. Broyles gently chastises her for assuming he doesn't agree. He's on board. Nina Sharp is out of surgery. Peter ( Joshua Jackson ) comes in to the lab. Walter ( John Noble ) didn't come home last night. Peter calls someone about Walter. Astrid ( Jasika Nicole ) can't find him either. Peter tells Olivia he understands why she had to say what she did. He's not worried about him.||||| Walter visits a grave, The Observer ( Michael Cerveris ) watches. Nina wakes up. Her electronic hand is on the fritz. Broyles is at her bedside. He asks her what Jones wanted with her arm. Nina asks for Olivia. Jones walks down a street carrying a briefcase, face partially bandaged. Olivia comes to Nina's room where specialists from Massive Dynamic are working on her. Jones and his crew start setting something up in the middle of a busy street. Nina tells Olivia that Jones worked for Bell 15 years ago but Bell isn't a terrorist. She says Jones was fired and was bitter about it since William was a father figure to him. She said after Jones busted out of prison he started calling for Bell a lot. Broyles tells Olivia that Nina thinks Jones wants to kill Bell. But she doesn't know where he is. She hasn't seen Bell for months. She thinks speaking to Bell has become more than a professional matter. She's counting on it. If Olivia can get to Jones first, she can talk to Bell.||||| Olivia asks what Jones did to Nina in the elevator after she was shot. Holding her bionic arm, she says Jones stole a very powerful energy cell Bell hid there. Jones delicately takes a small object out of a case and fits it into his machine. Through his bandages his face is bubbly and gross. The machine starts emitting a high pitched whine. People on the street start holding their ears. They increase the frequency. As Jones turns some knobs a whirring energy field appears in the street, like some sort of wormhole. Jones' men tell him they can't hold it open and it shuts, cutting off the back half of a truck that passed through. Jones says they're the wrong coordinates and they need to try again. When he removes his sunglasses we can see one of his eyes is now blue. Walter and The Observer walk along a beach. The Observer asks Walter if he recognizes a coin he's holding. Walter asks him how he got it. He says it looks similar to one Walter is thinking of, but it's different. \"There's more than one of everything,\" he says.||||| He asks him if the house they're in front of looks familiar and if he remembers what he has to find. He says there isn't much time. At Harvard, Broyles brings Nina into the lab. They ask her if Walter talked to anyone strange lately. Nina tells Peter that Jones has something Walter might know about. Nina calls someone for a search of Walter. Olivia and Charlie check out the half truck. Witnesses describe a curtain or window with a sheen that the truck came through. They describe a man in bandages. Nina shows Peter train security footage of his dad near a beach house they used to own. Peter wants to go up there himself. At the truck, Charlie gets a report the VIN and serial numbers don't exist and there's no record of it anywhere. Peter reaches the beach house. He looks around inside and finds Walter sitting by himself. He says he's looking for something. He's turning the coin over and over. He knows what he's looking for is important, but he can't remember what it is.||||| Olivia asks Nina where the truck came from. She asks where Bell is. She tells Nina to stop playing games or she'll turn this world over looking for him. Nina says that's the problem, he's not in this world. Providence, Rhode Island A black van pulls up to a kid's soccer game. Jones gets out. OIivia tries to talk Charlie through the idea Bell is in an alternate reality. That's why they can't ID the truck. It came from the other side. That's what Jones is using the energy cell for, to cross over to get to Bell. Their cell phones all ring. Walter searches frantically through the house, on the verge of a breakdown. Peter tries to calm him down, but he rails and thrashes and keeps searching. Peter tells his dad about fond memories of coming to the house as a kid, including Walter making pancakes. Walter gets excited when he remembers. He knows why he's there and where it is.||||| At the soccer field a kid describes a see-through wall that appeared, like a window. A kid ran into the shimmer and collapsed. They look at the body - it's cleanly sliced off. Charlie is ready to start buying the alternate reality theory. Olivia asks someone to run a check for all files mentioning science, biology or unexplained phenomena. All of them. She starts marking them on a map of New England with pushpins. She tells Broyles she thinks she found a connection and they need to call Nina. Walter opens a trunk in the beach house attic. He finds the box he was looking for with a coin just like the one The Observer gave him on top. It's a small tackle box, but it's locked. Olivia goes over the dots with Nina and Broyles. She marks the spots where Jones used his device. The other locations radiate out from them.||||| Walter opens the box and takes out a small object. He says when he and William were young they took copious amounts of LSD and became convinced they could experience alternate realities and some kids could see these alternate realities naturally.

Back at The Magic Box, Giles and Tara admire the new phone book advertisement for the magic shop while Anya is disappointed that she is not personally mentioned. Xander complains about Riley destroying the vampire crypt alone in the previous episode, and then the entire gang continues their search for information regarding the Beast.

Dreg promises that this spell will allow Glory to find the Key. She just needs some supplies, and she finds the advertisement for The Magic Box in the new phone book. Riley finds the front door to Buffy's house open, a blanket on the steps, and Spike in Buffy's room, sniffing her clothes. Spike declares that Buffy wouldn't care that he was in her room, and that the clothes-sniffing was just normal predator activity.

Joyce confesses to Buffy that the doctors have found a \"shadow\" in her CAT scan, and they need to do an initial operation to evaluate her condition, and to discover whether surgery is an option.

Howard tells them that he does not want to go, as the other guys, thinking that he was joking, laugh it off. The gang is gathering in front of the television in Leonard and Sheldon's apartment , getting ready to tune into Howard's launch. Amy is more fascinated by Sheldon 's recitation of the ingredients of the Pringles can, due to his eidetic memory.

Howard and his two fellow astronauts Dimitri Rezinov and Mike Massimino are on the launch pad waiting to go to the International Space Station . Howard tells them that he does not want to go, as the other guys, thinking that he was joking, laugh it off. The gang is gathering in front of the television in Leonard and Sheldon's apartment , getting ready to tune into Howard's launch. Amy is more fascinated by Sheldon 's recitation of the ingredients of the Pringles can, due to his eidetic memory.

Sheldon scares Bernadette by saying that soon Howard will have tons of fuel igniting under his butt so Bernadette asks Raj to give her the Pringles can and starts stress-eating.||||| Meanwhile, back inside the capsule, Mike Massimino mentions that \"Froot Loops\" was just married as the last week goes through Howard's mind. In the flashback, Howard gives Bernadette a necklace with a star on it which he plans to take into outer space with him as a gift that no one else could give to her, since she will have a star that actually have been in space. Bernadette is thrilled and tells him that she wants them married before he takes off in two days.||||| They go to Sheldon and Leonard's apartment and the whole gang is invited to meet them at Pasadena City Hall.

At City Hall, Amy wonders if seeing couples in love gets Sheldon thinking about it. All it does is make him bring up Leonard 's marriage proposal to Penny while they were having sex. The proposal surprises the others and \"thrills\" Penny that everybody knows.

{"Prompt": "Suppose you are a story-reteller, generate a list of main concepts to help me understand the story.\n\nStory: Arya practices her swordplay while real swordplay spills out of the throne room after Cersei and Joffrey tried to claim the throne. The fighting heads into the courtyard, where Cersei's men kill anyone who gets in their way. Sansa goes looking for her sister, but her nursemaid hears the fighting and sends Sansa to her room with strict instructions not to open the doors for anyone. The nursemaid confronts four armed men alone. Arya loses at her practicing when her teacher Syrio Forel says one direction and she listens and follows instead of reacting to what he's actually doing. He lectures her on following what she sees and reacting. Lannister men come for Arya, but Forel confronts them. Armed with only a wooden sword he takes on four men. She watches, amazed as he disarms all the men until the captain is left. Arya urges him to leave with her, but he refuses to back down.||||| The captain fights him and breaks the Forel's wooden sword. He sends Arya away, asking what they say to the god of death. \"Not today,\" she parrots. She leaves. She runs and hears screams as they fight. Sansa runs into the Hound in the hallway. She threatens to tell the queen. \"Who do you think sent me?\" he taunts. Arya runs into the courtyard and sees the box that holds her sword Needle. She looks for it when a boy comes up and threatens her.||||| She tells him to get away and whirls with her sword in her hand. She stabs him through the gut and runs. Varys pays Ned Stark a visit down in his dungeon cell. He tells him Arya escaped, but Sansa remains engaged to Joffrey. Varys tells Ned the rest of his household is all dead. Varys asks why he told Cersei he knew the truth. Ned claims it was mercy. Varys says Ned got Robert killed and tells him he's a dead man. Ned thinks he's safe because Catelyn has Tyrion, but Varys tells him Tyrion is free. Ned wants Varys to just kill him now, but he declines. On leaving, Varys claims to serve the realm, because no one else does.||||| Jon Snow and his men bring two dead men back from beyond the wall. Sam notices they're frozen solid and don't smell. The Lord Commander Mormont is notified of a raven from King's Landing. Jon joins him in his chambers and Mormont asks for ale for them both. He tells Snow of Robert's death and that Stark has been charged with treason for conspiring with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Joffrey. Sansa listens to Cersei, Master Pycelle, Varys and Petyr. Cersei says she can't marry Joffrey now because she's a traitor. Petyr argues she should have a chance to prove her loyalty. Cersei tells her to write to her mother and Robb, telling him to come to King's Landing and swear loyalty to Joffrey. She asks what will happen to her father. Cersei tells her that depends on her brother, and on her. Robb reads the letter, but Maester Luwin can tell Cersei told Sansa what to say. Robb knows he cannot ignore the official command, so he'll go -- but not alone. He tells Luwin to summon the banner men to defend his father. Hundreds of ravens fly from Winterfell.||||| At the Vale, Catelyn is incensed that her sister Lysa waited all day to show her the word from the raven. She wants Lysa to send men to fight for Ned, but Lysa worries about the safety of her son, Robin. She says the knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale to protect their lord. Tyrion and Bronn walk home. Bronn admits he's in it for the money. Tyrion says that's not a problem, he'll always pay more than the other guy. In the middle of the night, Bronn wakes up hearing noises. They are quickly surrounded by Stonecrows and their leader, Shagga, son of Dolf. Tyrion brags about his family's money while bashing their crappy weapons. Tyrion takes off his ring and hands it over. He tells him if they help him, he'll help the Stonecrows take over the Vale. Jon Snow works in the Wall kitchen, when his tormentor comes in and taunts him about being the bastard son of a traitor. Jon lunges at him with a knife, but men stop him. The Lord Commander comes in later and confines Jon to his quarters.||||| Later at night, Jon's direwolf Ghost won't stop barking. Jon lets him out and follows him to the commander's room. Instead of Mormont, a giant disfigured bald man comes at him. He stabs him, but the man keeps coming. The man falls and the Commander comes out of his room and sees. The man gets up and starts to attack again so Jon throws his lit lantern at him and hustles Mormont out. Daenerys walks through a burnt down village with Jorah as the Dothraki attack the inhabitants. He explains that the Dothraki are pillaging to raise money for ships to sail to Westeros, as she wants. Everywhere, women and children are screaming as the Dothraki attack them, claiming the spoils of their victory.||||| Daenerys commands them to stop attacking one woman. She claims others, even though Jorah tells her they belong to the warriors. Daenerys returns to camp to find her husband sitting next to a pile of severed heads. Mago , a warrior, is complaining to Khal that Daenerys took the women he was planning to \"mount.\" Daenerys makes a polite case for preventing the women from being raped, saying it is her will and as Khalessi he has to listen to her. Khal Drago enjoys seeing his fierce bride, but Mago says a khal who takes orders from a \"foreign whore\" isn't really a khal. He draws his sword. Drogo walks into it purposefully and presses his chest against it as he tells Mago what he'll do to his corpse. Without drawing his own weapon, Drogo ducks and darts to avoid Mago, then finally kills him with his own sword and rips out his tongue with his bare hands.||||| One of Daenerys's new slaves offers to help clean Drogo's cut. The Dothraki are suspicious, but Daenerys asks her husband to let the woman treat him. He relents. At Winterfell, Robb deals with the ego of the Greatjon, who demands he get to lead the vanguard into King's Landing, saying Robb is too green. He threatens to take his men and go home if not. Robb stares him down and says he's welcome to leave, but after he takes care of the Lannisters he'll come for him for breaking his oath to his father. Greatjon draws his sword and Robb's direwolf races at him and rips off a few fingers. Robb uses it as an excuse to show he knows enough to let a wolf deal with things for him. Cowed, the Greatjon laughs off the missing digits and the situation is diffused. Robb says good-bye to Bran in the middle of the night and tells him to stay at Winterfell. After he leaves, their younger brother Rickon comes in, worried about their parents.||||| The next day, Bran prays to the Old Gods. Osha, the captured wildling woman, tells him the gods heard him, but she predicts bad things for Robb headed south and tells Bran the true threat lies to the north. Sam, Jon Snow and the troops stand around the burning bodies of the men they found beyond the wall. Sam thinks they were touched by White Walkers. He read about them. He says they sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years. He hopes the wall is high enough to keep them out. Catelyn comes upon an encampment. Robb reports that the River Lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister on their heels, and Lord Tywin is bringing a larger army from the south. Catelyn walks in. She asks to talk to Robb alone, then hugs him. He shows her Sansa's letter. They notice there's no mention of Arya. Robb tells her he has 18,000 men.||||| Catelyn says their only hope is that he can defeat the Lannister army in the field. She reminds him what happened to the Targaryen children when they lost throne: they were butchered in their sleep, on the orders of Tywin Lannister. She tells him if he loses, the Starks all die. \"Well that makes it simple, then,\" he says. Tyrion and Bronn march with the Stonecrows. They reach Tywin Lannister's camp. Tyrion leads them in and makes introductions. Tyrion learns the Robert is dead and Cersei is essentially in charge of King's Landing. They know Robb called in his banners and is leading an army. Tyrion asks for the armor, swords and pikes to pay his debts. He's interrupted by an update from the field. Tywin announces he's moving against Robb Stark. He asks Shagga and his men to fight with him and promises them more loot. Shagga says only if Tyrion rides with them.||||| Robb tries to figure out his next move. They need to cross the river at the Twins, which Lord Frey controls. He's bannerman to Catelyn's father, but isn't exactly reliable. Robb's men bring in a Lannister spy they caught. They say he was counting the men. Robb asks how high he got. When the man says 20,000, Robb talks about mercy and commands his men to let him go. Robb tells the spy to tell Lord Tywin that \"winter is coming\" with 20,000 men. As soon as the spy leaves, the men wonder about his move. Ned is roused from his cell.||||| Sansa comes to court to hear Cersei force retirement on Ser Barristan from the King's Guard, which is supposed to be til death. \"You let my father die, you're too old to protect anyone,\" Joffrey snipes. Cersei announces Jaime will take over as lord commander of the King's Guard. Varys promises Barristan a good house, but Barristan is indignant. He draws his sword and tosses it on the floor, telling Joffrey to melt it and add it to the others in the throne. There's an announcement calling for any other business. Sansa steps forward. She begs mercy for her father. She reminds them that he never wanted to be hand and loved the king. She says Pycelle gave him milk of the poppy and he wasn't himself when he said Joffrey wasn't king. She begs Joffrey personally. Joffrey says Ned has to confess and say that he is the king or there will be no mercy. \"He will,\" she says.\n\n \n", "original_narrative": "Arya practices her swordplay while real swordplay spills out of the throne room after Cersei and Joffrey tried to claim the throne.

The latest film Cecilia sees is a fictitious RKO Radio Pictures film, The Purple Rose of Cairo. It is the story of a rich Manhattan playwright named Henry (Edward Herrmann) who goes on an exotic vacation to Egypt with companions Jason (John Wood) and Rita (Deborah Rush). While in Egypt, the three meet archaeologist Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels).||||| Tom is brought back for a \"madcap Manhattan weekend\" where he falls head-over-heels for Kitty Haynes (Karen Akers), a chanteuse at the Copacabana. After Cecilia sits through the film several times, Tom, noticing her, breaks the fourth wall, and emerges from the inner film's black-and-white world into the full color real world the other side of the cinema screen. He tells Cecilia that he is attracted to her after noticing her watching him so many times, and she takes him around her New Jersey town.

Dowd is an endlessly pleasant and delightfully eccentric bachelor living in a small town that isn't quite aware that its newest citizen is a invisible, 6'3\" white rabbit named \"Harvey,\" that only certain people can see. After supposedly meeting this rabbit - its origins attributed to the Celtic legend of the Pooka - Dowd's sanity is put into question by his equally eccentric sister, Veta Louise. Elwood casually drives his sister's guests from their house by introducing and carrying on one-sided conversations with his invisible and silent friend. His sister and niece, Myrtle Mae, resort to taking him to the local sanitarium to have him committed. However, owing to people not paying attention, interrupting, and cutting Elwood off as he is about to introduce his imaginary friend, it doesn't immediately appear that there is anything wrong with him, although the examining doctor is sure he is doing the right thing by admitting him.||||| Elwood is carted upstairs by a rough-handed and simple-minded man in the white coat while the examining doctor ushers the sister into the head psychiatrist's --Dr. Chumley's-- office to give a description of the problem. As Elwood is \"escorted\" to hydrotherapy, he tells the man in the white coat his friend \"Harvey\" is a \"Pooka\"||||| The Aide later looks up the definition in the dictionary: \"Celtic mythology, a mischievous spirit that takes animal form and appears sometimes to some people for the purpose of doing this and that.\" As Veta, still highly upset over Elwood driving away her friends, bemoans Elwoods delusions to Dr. Chumley, her frazzled manner and insistence that Elwood actually does have a six foot 3 inch invisible rabbit for a friend convinces Chumley it is she, not Elwood, who is hallucinating. He quickly has Veta carted upstairs and, fearing a lawsuit for incarcerating and treating a sane man, brings Elwood down and makes every manner of friendly gesture, including firing the examining doctor, Dr. Sanderson . His nurse, Miss Kelly, who is actually quite fond of Dr. Sanderson, is crestfallen, but, upset at being fired, the good doctor is unaware of her feelings for him, and this angers her.||||| Elwood in his normal good natured way takes no exception to any of the events and once again, as he is about to introduce \"Harvey,\" gets cut off, interrupted and ignored while Dr. Chumley pursues his patronizing commentary. Never one to interrupt, the pinnacle of politeness, Elwood lets him say whatever he is going to say and is finally given a pass to leave. Soon Veta's friends, including Judge Gaffney, and Myrtle Mae arrive. The mistake is uncovered, and the entire group goes into a panic trying to find Elwood. Veta and the Judge Gaffney promise to sue the sanitarium for wrongful incarceration and rough treatment. Distraught, Elwood drinks heavily and retires to his favorite watering hole, Charlie's. Dr. Chumley, himself, tracks Elwood down, but while he is doing this, everyone else is looking in other places. When it finally becomes apparent to everyone that the Doctor has been gone for over four hours and that Elwood is not back in custody, another major panic ensues and the group descends on Charlie's to see what has happened to Dr. Chumley.||||| Elwood, of course, is sitting alone, drinking, and maintains that the doctor left the bar with Harvey. They are convinced he is a madman and has done away with the doctor. However, in his easygoing and pleasant manner, Elwood sidetracks everyone with drinks and conversation and disarms them. Eventually the subject does turn back to the missing doctor, and the panic ensues again. The police are summoned, the heavy handed man in the white coat muscles Elwood back to the sanitarium, but not before becoming infatuated with Myrtle Mae and making advances toward her.||||| Although he is a big galoot, she's attracted to him. The entire entourage, of Veta, Myrtle Mae, Dr. Sanderson, Miss Kelly, Judge Gaffney, the guard and the police, arrive at the sanitarium in a police car and a taxi to discover the doctor is there. However, Dr. Chumley arrives back at the hospital with a look of admiration and fear. Dr. Chumley indeed did leave with Harvey, the Pooka, but he wisely does not say anything about it to anyone, dismisses them all and tells everyone that everything is under control. He tells Dr. Sanderson that he is a fine doctor and can have his job back, then disappears into his office. Sanderson then decides to administer a very powerful injection, called Formula 977, into Elwood that will make him cease with his delusions about the rabbit for once and for all.||||| Meanwhile the cab driver wants his money for the fare. No one seems to have any money so Veta says she'll pay. Digging everything out of her handbag, she discovers her money is gone. She assures the driver that if he waits until Elwood has his injection, she'll pay him handsomely when they are driven back home. The Cab driver however has dour insights into the effects of the injection about to be administered to Elwood. He says he's given many people a ride to the sanitarium for that injection and it changes them into crabby mean people; normal but irritable and unpleasant.||||| Elwood, the most disarming and engaging and mild mannered man in the universe, is on the verge of being turned permanently into a real nuisance, so Veta abruptly changes her mind and rushes in and prevents the injection. Dr. Chumley asks to see Elwood privately in his office where Elwood tells him tells the incredible story of how he came to meet Harvey, and explains the way in which people react when they meet them. Elwood also explains that Harvey has the power to stop time by saying:\n\n\"Did I tell you he could stop clocks? Well, you've heard the expression 'His face would stop a clock'? Well, Harvey can look at your clock and stop it. And you can go anywhere you like, with anyone you like, and stay as long as you like. And when you get back, not one minute will have ticked by. You see, science has overcome time and space. Well, Harvey has overcome not only time and space, but any objections.\"||||| By this point, Dr. Chumley is not only convinced of Harvey's existence, but has begun spending time with him on his own, and requests that Elwood allow Harvey to stay with him for a while and help him out by making his long-needed sabbatical a reality. Apparently this is one of the things Harvey can do if he is so inclined. Elwood asks Harvey if he will work with Chumley and tells Chumley that Harvey agrees. Dr. Sanderson pays for the cab and warms up to the nurse who has a crush on him. The entourage leaves, with the heavy-handed guard and Myrtle Mae making a date to see each other. As the sister digs in her pocketbook she discovers her money purse. She looks over her shoulder and says knowingly, \"Harvey,\" and shakes her head.||||| She knew Harvey existed, and was mischievous, and her only reason for wanting to have Elwood committed was that Elwood's insistence on introducing him to her guests was driving everyone away. As Elwood is leaving, Dr. Chumley asks Elwood for Harvey's help, and Elwood, being the obliging fellow he is, makes no objection. Dr. Chumley, arm in arm with an invisible companion, asks \"Have you ever been to Akron?\" In the final shot, after the gates to Chumley's Residence are closed, and Elwood is leaving, he stops, turns around and has a conversation with an invisible Harvey, who is already back from his trip to Akron (only a few minutes have gone by, but it was weeks due to Harvey the Pooka stopping time) and reaffirms their friendship. Harvey opens the security gate (showing only the control handles moving by themselves; Harvey is never seen on camera), and Elwood and his invisible companion saunter off towards the bus stop, following Veta and Myrtle Mae, towards the planned last stop of Charlie's Bar and another drink.\n\n \n", "original_narrative": "Elwood P.

{"Prompt": "Suppose you are a story-reteller, generate a list of main concepts to help me understand the story.\n\nStory: Eren Jaeger stands momentarily speechless over the burned body of his childhood friend, Armin Arlelt . He realizes he should have known what would happen, but had no choice but to rely on him. Eren hears the weight of a Titan landing in the distance, and turns around in time to see the Cart Titan , carrying Zeke on its back. The Cart Titan gallops across the rooftops to reach Eren, who quickly moves to hold the unconscious Bertholdt Hoover hostage, placing his blade at the Warrior 's throat. As the Cart Titan stops, Eren gets a better look at Zeke and sees that he has marks around his face that shows he can turn into a Titan. He realizes that he is probably the Beast Titan . Zeke looks at Eren in shock and asks if he is Eren Jaeger. He says Eren looks nothing like his father and tells him that he knows what Eren is going through, as they are both victims of Grisha Jaeger. As Zeke tells Eren that he has been brainwashed by his father, Eren realizes that Zeke resembles Grisha.||||| However, Zeke looks up with consternation when he sees that Levi Ackermann has survived his battle with the remaining Titans and has climbed to the top of Wall Maria . Being in no shape to fight him again, Zeke calls their fight a draw and apologizes to the unconscious Bertholdt, saying that it is the end for him. The Cart Titan turns to leave and Zeke tells Eren that one day he will be coming back to rescue him. The Cart Titan gallops away with Zeke in tow.||||| Levi lands on the rooftop near Eren after using the last of his gas. He demands the rest of Eren's blades and gas so he can pursue Zeke. Eren begins to comply when he hears Armin gasp for breath. Elsewhere in Shiganshina District , Hange Zoe asks a conscious, but dismembered, Reiner Braun about a metal case that was in his chest pocket. He tells Hange that it is a letter written by Ymir , and that the Scouts need to deliver it to Christa . Hange agrees, but only after they inspect it. They would like to ask him more questions, but draws their blade, feeling that he is not inclined to talk. Reiner does not disagree.||||| However, when Hange begins to cut Reiner's throat, Jean Kirschtein asks them to wait, thinking they might be able to steal his power . Prior to beginning the operation, Erwin Smith had laid out guidelines for the use of the Scout Regiment 's one syringe of Titan injection , with the expectation that they could possibly take the Beast, Armored , or Colossal Titan 's powers. Not only could the Scouts gain valuable information regarding Titan powers, but they could also revive a single soldier on the brink of death. However, Hange does not feel that all the conditions have been met. Levi has the injection, but they do not know his status and they are uncertain they have the time to find out.||||| Even if Hange cuts off Reiner's head, they are not certain if that will actually kill him. Jean argues though, that this is not like Hange, and asks how they are supposed to beat the Titans if they back down because they lack the knowledge. Hange considers and asks Mikasa Ackermann to meet up with Eren and Armin to check out their situation, then to refill her gas and retrieve the injection from Levi. If she cannot, then she is to fire a signal flare as a signal to end Reiner. Mikasa agrees and flies off to find Levi.\n\nMikasa arrives to find Eren bent over Armin, desperately encouraging his friend to breathe. Eren hurriedly asks Levi for the syringe so they can have Armin eat Bertholdt. Levi, after a moment's hesitation, agrees and pulls out the case with the injection. Seeing this, Mikasa fires a signal flare as directed, but before Hange can kill Reiner, the Cart Titan gallops up behind them. Jean quickly fires his omni-directional mobility gear and pulls Hange out of the way before the Cart Titan can eat them.||||| Hange gets back up in time to see that the Cart Titan has picked up Reiner in its mouth, and it runs away with him and Zeke. Jean curses and blames himself for intervening when Hange was about to kill Reiner, but Hange reminds him that ultimately they made the call. Hange decides that they should regroup with the others. As Levi is about to hand Eren the Titan injection, Floch climbs up on the rooftop, carrying Erwin on his back. Erwin is severely wounded, but still alive, and Floch has been looking for Levi in hopes that the injection could save him. Seeing this, Levi takes back the injection and has Floch bring Erwin onto the roof. Levi inspects and confirms that Erwin is still breathing, then announces that Erwin will receive the injection. Eren is horrified, reminding Levi that he had already agreed to use it on Armin. Levi responds that he will revive the one who can save humanity. He hears a blade being drawn and turns to see that Mikasa has drawn her weapon, tears in her eyes.||||| On the Wall, Zeke surveys the wasteland of Shiganshina and notes that Reiner was incredibly lucky to have survived. Realizing what Eren and Mikasa intend, Levi asks them if they understand what they are doing. He reminds them that Erwin is their commander, and to stay out of his way. Eren grabs onto the serum in Levi's hand, and Levi orders him to keep his emotions in check. Eren then furiously asks why Levi did not use the serum on Armin right away. Levi admits that he was considering the possibility of Erwin still being alive, and now that Erwin is here, he will receive the injection. Eren tightens his grip on the Titan injection, and Levi, losing his patience, strikes Eren with his fist, knocking out several of his teeth and sending him flying. Outraged, Mikasa lunges at Levi and puts her blade to his throat. She realizes that Levi has been weakened from his previous battles, and she is certain that she can take the injection from him by force.||||| Both Levi and Floch appeal to her sense of reason and the need to save Erwin so they can use his talents to save humanity. Though Eren is barely able to speak, he counters that it would be no different if they lose Armin. Armin discovered Annie Leonhart 's identity as the Female Titan , he was the one who came up with the plan to save Trost and thought of moving soldiers at night, and it was thanks to Armin that they found Reiner and defeated Bertholdt. Eren believes that Armin will be the one who will save humanity, not Erwin or even Eren himself.||||| Mikasa renews her efforts to take the injection from Levi, but Floch stands up to her, saying that she is not the only one who has had it rough. Floch lets her know that all of the Scouts that were on the other side of the Wall are dead, killed by the Beast Titan's barrage. Erwin came up with a plan to fight back against the Beast Titan, and Floch's comrades were all slaughtered just as planned. When Floch found Erwin, he thought about killing him, but decided that would have been too easy. He wants Erwin to endure more of this hell, but then he looked to his left and saw Levi killing the Titans, and is reminded of the Titan injection. It takes a devil to fight the Titans, and Floch believes he was spared from dying so that he could bring Erwin back.||||| Floch tries to take the injection and Mikasa moves to intercept him, but Hange grabs her first and manages to pull her away before she can strike him. The rest of the squad has arrived now, and is able to see the choice that must be made. Levi gets up and opens the injection case, preparing to inject Erwin. Mikasa screams and Hange reminds her of how much they need Erwin and that they know what it is like to lose people.||||| Hange is only here now because Moblit Berner had died pushing them into a well to escape the Colossal Titan's transformation blast. Though there are countless people Hange wants to bring back, there comes a time to say farewell, and they have no choice but to keep moving forward. Hearing this, Mikasa finally relents and Levi prepares the injection. However, Eren weakly pulls at Levi's leg and asks him if he knows about the sea. Despite Floch's intervention, Eren tells Levi about Armin's dream to look at the sea, and admits that, though he was only ever driven by hatred of the Titans, Armin is not like him, and has dreams of his own. Levi glances at Armin's body and then gives the order for everyone to clear out so he can have Erwin eat Bertholdt. The group relocates, with Floch taking Eren away so he cannot intervene, and Levi is left alone.||||| Levi drags Bertholdt into position as he thinks about Erwin and Armin's respective dreams. He takes Erwin's arm and prepares to give him the injection when Erwin suddenly lifts it out of his grip and raises his hand, apparently believing himself to be back in his father's classroom. Delirious, Erwin asks his father how they can know for sure that there are no more humans outside the Walls. Levi regards him with surprise and remembers how he asked Erwin to give up on his dream, and how his uncle Kenny Ackermann had spoken about how people could only keep going if they were drunk on something. Remembering Erwin's gratitude to him, Levi makes his choice. Bertholdt wakes up in time to see a small blond Titan looming over him.||||| He begins to struggle and notices his former friends watching from several rooftops away. Bertholdt panics and cries out for help, but to no avail. As he screams for Annie and Reiner, Armin's Titan closes its jaws on his head and devours him. Floch asks Levi why he changed his mind as Levi and Hange sit beside Erwin's body. Levi explains that Erwin only became a devil because that was what was needed of him. He had been set free, but they were about to drag him back for more, and Levi decided it was time to let him rest. Levi apologizes to Erwin that he was not able to kill the Beast Titan like he promised, so he will have to wait. Hange inspects Erwin and lets Levi know that he has passed away. Behind them, the blond Titan collapses to the ground.

Black shows up and says he wants their help sending David a message and then proceeds to backhand Emily across the face We see Jack informing David that Black has been released and his flash drive is gone. Since Black thinks Kate is still alive David knows he won't leave town anytime soon. At the station Jack asks Hunter to help him find Black. It turns out Hunter is pretty well informed on the situation, including Emily's real identity. He uses Alvarez' disappearance to convince Hunter to help. David is texted a video from Black that features Emily and Victoria. He wants his daughter back the following day, unharmed. David fills in Jack and Hunter as to the latest with Black's demands.

Victoria she think she owes it to David not to go after Emily.||||| Victoria isn't interested in helping Emily try to escape from their imprisonment. Louise's mother Penelope shows up to see her daughter and introduces herself to Nolan. To Louise's horror Penelope has rented a place for the summer.

{"Prompt": "Suppose you are a story-reteller, generate a list of main concepts to help me understand the story.\n\nStory: Shaquille O'Neal and Dr. Phil wake up chained in a bathroom (spoofing Saw). Shaq has to make a free throw with a huge rock in order to get the saw down to cut off their legs (spoofing Shaq's famous difficulties at the free-throw line). Shaq and Dr. Phil have only two minutes to free themselves of their leg braces before dying from the room's airborne nerve gas. Finally, Shaq makes the basket and lowers the saws down. Dr. Phil ends up sawing off the wrong foot, thereby remaining chained and the two are presumed to be dead. Tom Logan (Charlie Sheen), spoofing Bill Pullman's character from The Grudge, wakes up.||||| There are three girls (from The Girls Next Door on E!) in his bed who later have a pillow fight. He tries to kill himself by taking too many sleeping pills but the pills turn out to be Viagra, resulting in him tumbling over a balustrade, landing on his erect penis, and dying. Cindy Campbell goes to get a new job (parodying Sarah Michelle Gellar's character in The Grudge). She's been asked to be a caretaker for the creepy \"Grudge House.\" She receives a tour inside, Cindy expects nothing and she gets a 'feeling of evil' as the guide tries to hide the overflowing hair on the ceiling, in drawers and baskets and on his head; and The Grudge Boy in the bathtub by pushing him down with a plunger, and then walks out naked and Cindy smiles and says \"I'll take it\".||||| Meanwhile, Cindy's neighbour Tom Ryan (Craig Bierko), spoofing Tom Cruise's character in War of the Worlds, gets fired from his job as a crane operator at the docks. At a bar afterwards he runs into Mahalik (Anthony Anderson) and CJ (Kevin Hart) where it is revealed, in a parody of Brokeback Mountain, that the two have started a homosexual relationship. Tom gets home, where his ex-wife (Molly Shannon) has just arrived with his children, Robbie and Rachel, who both resent him. Cindy's job is to look after the incapacitated Mrs. Norris (Cloris Leachman), however she is incompetent at it, to the point of accidentally sponge bathing Mrs. Norris with her own urine. Throughout the night Cindy notices strange events going on in the house, culminating in her finding a ghostly boy in the attic.||||| The next morning she confides in Tom about the events of the previous night, which leads to a conversation about their past relationships.||||| Cindy has a flashback to her first marriage, showing a big African-American man cussing her out, and then another to her second marriage, to the death of her husband George (Simon Rex) where, in a parody of Million Dollar Baby, George trips and breaks his neck (as do numerous members of the audience) during a boxing match between Cindy and Tiffany Stone, a female version of Mike Tyson also showing a pile of bitten-off ears. As they share a kiss, the sky suddenly goes stormy and everything electrical stops working (In the real movie cars stopped working, but in this movie cars, bicycles, skateboards and a man runs out of a toilet, trousers down and holding a newspaper (\"My bowels have stopped moving!\"). Tom goes to investigate, and discovers the world has come under attack by gigantic triPods (giant iPods) that play 80s music... and then switches to the \"Destroy Humanity\" playlist, transforming the iPods into actual Tripods, which vaporize the humans they zap (it was also showed three people which seemed to be rappers, get vaporized and dropping a huge pile of bling-blings).||||| Cindy runs back into her house and finds the ghost boy again. They began talking in \"Japanese\" (actually Japanese brand names and \"buzz words\" such as Sony, Mitsubishi, and Fujitsu), in what may be a parody of the scene between Beatrix Kiddo and Pai Mei in Kill Bill in which Pai Mei says \"Your Japanese is lousy. It dishonors my ears.\", which the ghost boy says to Cindy. She is told by the ghost boy that she can find the answer to the alien attack when she finds his father. He gives her directions to his location but Cindy couldn't read them so they transformed into a Yahoo map so that Cindy could read it. Tom splits up with Cindy and flees with his kids. Cindy runs into Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall), who apparently faked her death in Scary Movie 3, and together they manage to find the last working car and follow the directions of the ghost boy.||||| The scene then changes to the President of the United States being informed that aliens are attacking. President Baxter Harris (Leslie Nielsen) is sitting in Edna R. Penhall Elementary School, listening to a book being read (something about a duck); when his aide Jamison (Alonzo Bodden) comes, he sits motionless, wanting to hear the rest of the story. This mirrors George W. Bush's being read a children's story for seven minutes, after being told about the September 11 attacks.||||| At an emergency session of the UN, and a round of horribly inappropriate jokes, President Harris reveals a weapon made to combat the aliens. Scientists have taken the lasers used by the TriPods, which kill the people but leave their clothes behind, and modified it to do the opposite to the aliens. The members of the UN get an unexpected, and quite unwelcome, demonstration when President Harris accidentally hits the switch and is soon standing in front of all the delegates, completely unaware that he is totally naked. Its not long before the entire UN is stark naked. Baxter's aide Harper (Bryan Callen) tells Baxter that he's naked too where Baxter thinks that he was wearing a wrinkly leather coat. Harper escorts the President out of the UN.||||| Cindy and Brenda come across a village that is a hundred years behind modern times. After unsuccessfully trying to steal clothes off some villagers, they take some from a laundry basket and attempt to fit in. Unfortunately, they are captured and are taken into a court to decide their fate. Henry Hale (Bill Pullman), the head of the village, rules that Cindy and Brenda may stay in the village, but they may never leave. Tom and his children run into a battle between the Army and triPods.||||| Robbie decides to join the fight, excited by the graphic violence. While Tom tries to dissuade him, Michael Jackson (who has gathered a bunch of children) tries to persuade Rachel to come with him, but Tom manages to stop her in time. Unfortunately, Robbie gets away. Jackson is zapped by the triPod's heat ray; the first blast causes him to revert to his Bad appearance, the second into his Thriller appearance, and the third reveals his true form - a balding middle-aged black man - before a fourth blast destroys him totally, leaving only his nose. Tom and his daughter flee into house protected by Oliver (Michael Madsen), parodying Tim Robbins' character from War of the Worlds, who is telling them that they should make their own tripods (\"Ours will have FOUR legs\").||||| That night, the village is attacked by Those We Don't Speak Of, however it is discovered that they are simply villagers in costumes. Next door, Henry is stabbed by the mentally challenged Ezekiel (Chris Elliott). Henry reveals to Cindy and Brenda that he is the father of the ghost boy, who was killed at Cindy's boxing match because everyone snapped their necks and Don King crushed him. He tells Cindy that only she has the power to defeat the triPods. At that point, Cindy and Brenda get captured by a triPod, as do Tom and Rachel. The characters wake up in the bathroom from Saw. Cindy and Brenda are wearing the \"Venus Fly Trap\" from Saw II and Tom is wearing a device that would shoot a large dildo into his anus.||||| Jigsaw appears on a monitor on the wall, and tells them they have 60 seconds to get the Venus Fly Traps off before they close. Eventually, Cindy figures out (after much prompting) that she has to get the key from behind her eye, which she does with ease, because the key was behind a glass eye she got due to a \"bad bar fight in '96\".||||| Cindy frees them from their traps, and Tom's kids come down from the ceiling, about to be sliced into bits unless he holds onto a rope which happens to be between an iron maiden. He grabs onto the rope which leaves him open to another torture device called the Nut Cracker, which gives him various punishments such as kicking his crotch, and giving him a purple nurple and a wet willy. Moments before their deaths, Cindy finds photos in the toilet of Jigsaw, a woman, and the ghost boy, and realizes that Jigsaw was the ghost boy's real father, and the entire invasion was revenge for his son's death. He then says \"Anyone can hold a grudge, but it takes real courage to forgive,\" and it is at this time that Jigsaw comes into the spotlight. He then tells them that the invasion is over and allows them to leave.||||| He apologizes for the invasion and killing millions of people, and then Brenda (who went through a rotating wall into the control room earlier) and Jigsaw's brother, Zoltar, emerge from the other room, where they have just had sex. Jigsaw asks Zoltar if he caught anything, Zoltar replies that Brenda (untruthfully) told him she was a virgin and Jigsaw finishes by saying \"We are so fucked.\"||||| Nine months later, Brenda gives birth to a baby that looks just like Jigsaw and Zoltar. After that, James Earl Jones gets hit by a bus (which may be referring to what happened to Terry in Final Destination) while delivering Morgan Freeman's closing lines from War of the Worlds. A five minute epilogue spoofs the Tom Cruise couch incident by showing an Oprah Winfrey Show episode with Tom Ryan jumping on a couch with Oprah (played by Debra Wilson). Tom runs around the studio, does backflips (performed by David Leighton), swings across the studio, and chews/rips apart one of the couch cushions. Cindy Campbell walks in and gets thrown by Tom off the stage. Tom then breaks Oprah's hands and wrists, smashes a chair over her head, runs towards the camera lens, and the screen goes black.\n\n \n", "original_narrative": "Shaquille O'Neal and Dr. Phil wake up chained in a bathroom (spoofing Saw).

Despite Jerry's complaint of fever, James whisks him by helicopter to a remote giant sinkhole, where Jerry helps James and his assistants set up cones to catch falling butterflies as James pumps smoke into the trees. Several huge spiders also fall, and James captures two in jars, but a third spider slips into Jerry Manley's backpack. Back in camp, as James studies the spiders, he notes that, like solider ants, they have no reproductive organs. While Jerry rests in his tent, the third spider crawls from his backpack and delivers a fatal bite to his stomach. Thinking Jerry died of fever, James packs his body into a box to be shipped home, but the spider slips inside. When the body arrives in Canaima, California, mortician Irv Kendall is shocked at its desiccated condition, as if something sucked it dry. The spider sneaks out of the box and escapes through a cat door.||||| A crow swoops down and picks it up, but soon plummets lifelessly into the yard of a house where Dr. Ross Jennings, his wife Molly, and children Tommy and Shelley have just arrived from San Francisco, California. Dr. Jennings has chosen to take over as town physician when Dr. Samuel \"Sam\" Metcalf retires the following week. Tommy Jennings sees the large spider and reports it to his mother, who finds a smaller, harmless spider instead and releases it in the barn out back. The foreign spider joins the domestic spider, and the two mate. When Dr. Jennings visits Sam to discuss taking over his practice, the old physician has second thoughts about retiring. Jennings panics, because he has bought a house and rented an office in Canaima. Retired schoolteacher Margaret Hollins volunteers to be his first patient, and when he gives her a check-up, he discovers that Sam unnecessarily put Margaret on high blood pressure medication.||||| Meanwhile, Molly, an amateur photographer, takes pictures of a large web in the barn. Hoping to cure her husband of his fear of spiders, she takes him to see it, but Ross is terrified by his earliest childhood memory of a spider crawling on him. Just out of sight in the loft, an egg sac pulsates. Later, Margaret throws a lawn party to introduce Dr. Jennings to the townspeople, and Tommy and Shelley make friends with neighbor Bunny Beechwood, whose father, Henry Beechwood, is the high school coach. Other guests include Jerry Manley's parents, grieving over their son's death and angry they could not view his body before burial. That evening, a spider gets into Margaret's house and fatally bites her hand. The next day, Dr. Jennings attempts to convert his basement into a wine cellar, but the wood is rotten. When he fires a nail gun into the ceiling, the nails shoot through the floor boards above.||||| He goes to Margaret's to thank her for the party, and sees her body through a window. Sam Metcalf declares she had a heart attack and blames Ross for taking her off blood pressure pills. Recognizing signs of convulsion, Ross suggests an autopsy, but Sam refuses, because locals object to having their bodies desecrated. Margaret is buried without being examined. Meanwhile, Molly Jennings hires local exterminator Delbert McClintock to check the house for termites, but he finds only \"bad wood.\" Henry Beechwood asks Dr. Jennings to give his football players physical examinations. Later, during practice, a spider crawls into a football helmet. After player Todd Miller puts it on, he is bitten while being tackled and dies. His teammates surround him, take off the helmet, and lay it aside. Nobody sees the spider crawling out, but a player steps on it and kills the arachnid without noticing.||||| Though Todd's death is blamed on the tackle, some wonder if Dr. Jennings is to blame and call him \"Dr. Death.\" That night, Dr. Sam Metcalf steps off his treadmill before bed, puts his foot into a slipper, and is bitten. His wife, Evelyn, calls Dr. Jennings, but the old doctor is dead by the time he arrives. When County Medical Examiner Milton \"Milt\" Briggs arrives, Dr. Jennings tells him that Metcalf's wife saw a spider, then shows him a bite on the old doctor's toe. Milt argues, however, that spider bites are rarely fatal. He blames the elderly doctor's death on overexertion on the treadmill. Dr. Jennings demands an autopsy, and the next day, Briggs telephones to say Dr. Metcalf died from a tiny amount of unknown toxin. Over the objection of Sheriff Lloyd Parsons, Dr. Jennings asks Milt to exhume Todd Miller and Margaret Hollins.||||| Dr. Jennings warns his children to watch out for spiders. While playing with Bunny at the Beechwood house, Shelley Jennings is almost bitten by a spider, but Bunny innocently drops a large book on it. Meanwhile, Ross finds a cricket in the house and realizes he has not heard them lately, even though crickets chirping on quiet evenings was one of Canaima's selling points. Seeing that Dr. James Atherton, one of America's foremost entomologists, is studying spiders at a California university, he telephones him. Atherton tells him that people frequently report false outbreaks of spider deaths. However, after he hangs up, Dr. Atherton vaguely recalls the name Canaima. Studying his new species of Venezuelan spiders, he asks his assistant, Chris Collins, to investigate. Chris arrives in Canaima just as Dr. Jennings and Milt find spider bites on the exhumed bodies of Todd Miller and Margaret Hollis. The young assistant telephones Dr. Atherton and asks him to come.||||| The next day, as Dr. Jennings, Milt, Sheriff Parsons, and Chris search Margaret's property, they find a large web filled with fragments of crickets, along with a dead spider. Chris Collins observes that another spider drained it, because spiders are like vampires. Suddenly, a spider menaces them. Dr. Jennings freezes with fear, but makes enough movement to distract the spider, allowing Chris to drop a glass over it. Nearby, as Bunny's older sister, Becky Beechwood, takes a shower, a spider drops on her from the shower rod, but the rushing water sends it skittering down into the drain. Henry Beechwood telephones Delbert McClintock, who arrives and finds a spider on the front walk. The exterminator's insecticide has no effect, however, so he squashes the spider with his boot. When Dr. James Atherton arrives in town, Dr. Jennings claims that he and Irv Kendall have already figured out that a spider escaped from his Venezuelan camp in Jerry Manley's casket.||||| Studying the captured spider, Atherton notes the huge fangs and the lack of sex organs, which is uncharacteristic of spiders, except for the Venezuelan species. He explains that this type of spider has been trapped for millennia in a deep gorge, but now one of them has mated with a local species, and their offspring will spread out. Though these sexless spiders will soon die, a new queen has probably been born, and her offspring will be unstoppable. Her nest must be destroyed. That night, at Irv Kendall's house, a spider gets into a bowl of popcorn and kills him and his wife. The next day, when Atherton goes to Dr. Jennings' office with Sheriff Parsons, he sees Molly's photographs of the huge barn web and demands to go there. Elsewhere, Chris Collins tells Dr. Jennings the queen will be hiding in a dark, musty place, and no other spiders will be around because the queen protects her babies.||||| Plotting a map of where spiders were seen or people were bitten, Chris draws a circle around the Jennings house. Meanwhile, as Atherton investigates the web in the barn, the original Venezuelan spider fatally bites him. Dr. Jennings arrives to evacuate his family, but they are surrounded by hundreds of spiders and must escape through an upstairs window. However, Jennings again freezes at the top of the stairs and tumbles over the railing. He crashes through the rotted ground floor and lands in the cellar. Seeing no spiders, he knows from what Chris Collins said that this must be where the queen is hiding.||||| When it attacks him, he shovels the spider toward a broken fuse box and electrocutes her. Finding a giant egg sac, he douses it with wine. As the original Venezuelan spider drops down on him, he knocks it away, chases it with flames, and sets part of the basement on fire. He momentarily freezes as the spider crawls up his leg, then knocks it away into the fire. As the flaming creature leaps at him again, Ross fires his nail gun and sends the burning spider into the egg sac, setting it afire. Delbert McClintock pulls him to safety. Later, Dr. Jennings and his wife, having returned to San Francisco, drink wine, happy to be home.

Vincent have to keep their marriage a secret when investigator, Daniel Breeden, uncovers evidence that may show that the governor took a bribe from John F. Holdstock, an embezzling financier he pardoned. John's private secretary, Willis Martin, who deposited the bribe money in the governor's private bank account, tells Robert and Daniel that he knows of no business between John and the governor that would explain the money. Sheldon goes to the Governor's Residence to tell Ruth about the situation, and that he is obligated to present the evidence to a legislative investigation committee. Ruth is certain that her father did not take a bribe, and that John can explain everything, but they learn by phone from Daniel that John has committed suicide. The Governor is concerned about the allegations, but his financial backer, Jim Lansdale, calms him down, and takes him to lunch. Before he does he makes a phone call in which he learns that Sheldon is at the Governor's residence, but he does not tell the Governor this.||||| In John's papers, Robert finds a typed note which apparently provides a motive for the bribe: \"My dear friend John ... the expense of maintaining my sockfarm has exceeded the income during the year ... the time for the matter we discussed has come. W.H.V.\" Robert rushes to show it to Ruth, and they decide to take it to police headquarters to be compared with a sample from the governor's personal typewriter. Lt. Tom Nigard shows them the comparison: both samples are definitely from the same machine. Ruth returns home to tell her father about the evidence, and he adamantly denies that he wrote the note, giving her his word of honor. That night, Daniel goes to John's office, where a very spooked Willis is still working. Daniel tries to calm him down, telling him \"You have nothing to worry about, it's almost over. I've seen you through today as I promised, haven't I? ... You were splendid today in Robert's office. You just stick to your story and remember that I'm taking care of you.\"||||| Ruth goes to Robert's apartment to tell him that she's absolutely certain her father is innocent. While she is there, Sheldon's secretary, Hazel Normandie leaves for the day, planning to meet Daniel, her boyfriend, outside the building. As he walks up to her, Daniel is shot dead. Ruth has seen everything from the window, and knows that Hazel didn't fire the shot, but cannot tell the police because of her secret marriage to Robert: if it was learned that she was in his apartment at night, she fears that their marriage will be discovered. The police investigation of Daniel's murder determines that the gun used to kill him belonged to Hazel, the same gun that Daniel took from her earlier in the day, saying that he was all the protection she needed. At a raucous session of the legislature, Representative McPherson, from the party opposing the Governor, accuses both the governor and Attorney General Sheldon of withholding evidence from the investigative committee. They are staunchly defended by Representative Grosvenor, but McPherson demands articles of impeachment against the governor and intensive investigation of Robert. Ruth observes it all from the gallery.||||| Hazel is standing trial for the murder of Daniel, with the case about to go to the jury, but Ruth still refuses to testify, knowing that the revelation of her secret marriage with Robert would end his career. With little time to waste, Ruth goes to the apartment of Willis, who appears to be cracking up. Willis admits to her that John didn't commit suicide, he was murdered, and says that he is willing to tell Robert so, but once at Robert's office he runs away; Sheldon puts out an alert for the police to pick him up. Now, with no other choice, he and Ruth head to the courthouse, where the jury is voting, and find Hazel's attorney. The judge reopens the case to allow Ruth to testify, and Hazel is acquitted. The next morning, Governor Vincent is annoyed that Ruth didn't tell him about the marriage, but understands that the circumstances necessitated it. With the governor's impeachment trial due to start soon, Jim Lansdale counsels the governor to resign, but he refuses.

When John denied he had any money, Willis shot and killed him, and Daniel fixed it to look like suicide.

At one point, the cow's \"pants\" drop, revealing polka-dotted underwear. Bosko points and laughs, at which the cow pulls her pants back on and walks off in a huff--with her nose up and tail held erect. Next, Bosko laughs heartily at a horse and the horse laughs back. He then climbs onto the horse carriage and uses a whip to play the horse's tail like a violin. He tunes the \"horse\" by twisting his ear. The horse seems to enjoy the music and dances in an odd fashion. He skates along, floats a few feet above the ground and makes swishing movements, with his hooves, as if mimicking a mop.

I hear it was amazing!||||| In her hotel room, Elizabeth calls the front desk to complain about a (planted) stain on the bedsheets. She flirts with Neal, gets his business card, and an offer for dinner. Philip meets with Gabriel who tells him Yousaf contacted the Rezidentura in Islamabad , but refused to talk to them. Instead, he's flying to the US to meet with Philip directly. He also tells Philip that Elizabeth asked for Mischa to be sent home from the war , but he turned it down. Gabriel says they can force Mischa to go home, but Philip refuses. The Jennings arrive home to find Paige still up.||||| She confronts them about constantly being called away from home, the late nights at work and having no extended family. Then how about dinner? Having felt for years that she was abnormal for her doubts about her family, she's realized she has legitimate concerns. She says if they really love her they will stop lying to her and sobs. Philip and Elizabeth fall silent for a long time before Philip nods slightly and they sit down on either side of Paige at the table. They tell her they were born in the Soviet Union and that they work for their country, getting information that can't be obtained any other way. Paige is stunned to learn they are spies and leaving the kitchen, is stopped by her parents. They warn her that she now bears a great responsibility and that she can't tell anyone, not Pastor Tim nor Henry, or they will both go to jail, forever. This isn't normal.||||| Having laid in bed all night thinking, the next morning Paige tells her parents she doesn't want to go to school and doesn't want them to stay at home with her. She demands they speak Russian and Elizabeth says \"We love you very much\" which Philip translates. The Jennings then sit in their car in the garage, debating whether it's safe to leave her alone. Knowing any pressure will be counter-productive, they leave and spend a long, anxious day at work. Paige calls Pastor Tim while they're gone, to tell him she talked to her parents, but she doesn't reveal what she learned. I need to be alone.||||| Stan meets with Walter Taffet , discusses his failed marriage and lies that an affair wasn't the cause of his divorce. Taffet asks if Stan suspects anyone of planting the bugged pen in Agent Gaad's office but after hesitating, he says no. Noticing Martha isn't at her desk, he asks Aderholt where she is. He indicates she left early. In the secure room at the Rezidentura, Arkady tells Oleg that he's frustrated with the Center's demands for photos of a stealth bomber. Tatiana interrupts and after Oleg leaves, she shows Arkady the message that Zinaida left at the movie theater bathroom indicating she was threatened by a KGB agent. As Zinaida's mission is so secret, they wrongly believe that the threat was approved by someone in the KGB who didn't know about it, Arkady leaves to report the incident. Stan arrives at the Jennings for dinner and Paige stares at him. While sharpening a large knife to cut meat with, Philip covers for her and they sit down to eat. An apple with a worm in it.

Billie Green is watching closely as he carefully is examining the dolls. Nathan asks he was seeing. Billie reaches for one specific doll, \"Baby Nancy\" and says that this is the doll that changed the toy industry. Nathan looks at Billie in wonderment with one question, how? Green explains that before this doll other black doll representations were either negative stereotypes such as a Mamie or Uncle Tom, or the mold used was a white doll with brown paint. But this doll, Baby Nancy, she was specifically designed to have black features, natural hair and was modeled after a young black girl in the community of South LA.||||| Green turns the doll over to show the back of the neck, and shows Nathan that it is inscribed with \"Shindana Toys\" and underneath \"Division of Operation Bootstrap\". Green gives the history of Operation Bootstrap and that this organization grew from the Watts uprising by two men in particular, Lou Smith and Robert Hall, bringing training and education to the neighborhood as well as partnering with local organizations and businesses to enhance the neighborhood. Green explains that there was a shift in the community to self-identify and one of the most successful initiatives of Operation Bootstrap, Shindana Toy Company, was pivotal to this for young kids both black and white. Hester explains how the psyche behind Shindana was to give black children a doll that they could identify with as well as to teach children tolerance. The company even marketed the doll to both black and white children to teach them how to relate at a young age.||||| She goes on to explain that the success transformed the doll industry and grew so large that it opened up distribution centers in New York, Chicago, and Houston. Green points out her specific dolls and explains that they reached to celebrities like Flip Wilson and Dr. J. And they even created a \"lil cousins\" brand that which featured multicultural dolls, expanding their brand. Green shares the stories behind her dolls and personal connection behind collecting them. Nathan thanks Billie for her time and heads out.

His understanding of South Los Angeles after the riots is that businesses fled and the community was left in socioeconomic distress, but he hasn't heard this more positive narrative of self-help organizations like Operation Bootstrap let alone this toy factory! Smith goes on to say that Operation Bootstrap, however, did not just have impact on those within the community.

{"Prompt": "Suppose you are a story-reteller, generate a list of main concepts to help me understand the story.\n\nStory: Bill has killed three of the werewolves who had surrounded him, and has bitten off another's ear. Just before going at it with the last wolf, Mississippi vampire king Russell Edgington rides up in hunting garb. He chastises one of the wolves for attacking Bill instead of kidnapping him as ordered. When Russell learns they fed on Bill, he shoots one of the two surviving wolves, and takes Bill back to his home. Lafayette frantically tries to make sure Tara throws up all of the pills she's taken in her suicide attempt. He yells at Lettie Mae for not paying attention to her daughter and takes Tara away with him. Sookie goes to see Eric about helping her find Bill. She shows him the runic brand they found on the dead werewolf. He tells her it's too dangerous for her to go poking around. In the bathroom, Pam is fixing her make-up and Jessica asks her how to feed on humans without killing them. She then wants to know how to dispose of one you've accidentally killed.||||| Sookie gets weepy, talking about Bill being missing, and tells Eric he owes her after she risked her life to help him find Godric. This emotion gets to Eric. As soon as Sookie leaves, Eric has a flashback to the 1940s. He and Godric watch an American soldier attempt to help a woman. She turns into a werewolf and kills the soldier. Eric and Godric jump out and pin the wolf to the wall. She yells that they are on the \"same side.\" When Eric sees the werewolf has one of the brands on her neck he says, \"No, we are not.' Russell brings Bill inside his stately residence. He is introduced to Russell's boyfriend, Talbot, and they show Bill to the luxurious room where he will be confined. On the way to the hospital, Tara assures Lafayette that she puked up all of the pills in her system. He tells her that Eggs \"would want you to live.\" When Tara doesn't seem so sure, Lafayette says he needs to show her something.||||| Sookie leaves Jessica at Bill's place, where Hoyt is waiting on the porch with a few bottles of True Blood. When Hoyt tells Jessica he knows what she was going through, being so hungry, she says he simply does not understand and storms inside crying. Inside she finds her rotting kill still in Bill's secret resting spot and climbs in with the corpse. At home, Sookie is surprised to find Jason. He tells her he's been having trouble sleeping and came over to do some cleaning. As they clean the kitchen Sookie tells Jason about the werewolves and the fact she feels helpless about Bill's disappearance. Jason thinks Andy might be able to help. Sam has fallen asleep at the wheel outside the Mickens residence. He is awakened by Tommy Mickens (who her had followed from the auto repair shop) pointing a shotgun in his face. Tommy brings Sam inside. When Sam tells his mother (Melinda) it's been 34 years since they've met, she knows right away who he is. She gives a look to husband Joe Lee who also seems to understand.||||| Sookie spots a werewolf staring at her from the woods near the bar. He disappears when Terry walks by, and the two search for clues. They find biker shoe prints and wolf prints, followed by a pair of discarded boots. Lafayette takes Tara to an institution. He tells the receptionist he wants to see Ruby Jean Reynolds, his mother. We see her in her room being fed by a young Latino orderly, Jesus. She is seriously delusional. Andy gives a statement to the press as Jason walks up to the station.||||| Andy isn't happy to see him and offers to take Jason out to lunch. Sookie tells Terry not to tell anyone about the man they saw. He gives her a revolver for protection. Sookie suggests he tell Arlene that he's \"good at things.\" Melinda tells Sam that Joe Lee was in prison when she had him. Melinda thought Sam would have a better life with another family. Joe Lee wasn't aware of Sam's existence until he had already been given away to the Merlottes. Sam learns that Melinda and Tommy are shapeshifters, but Joe Lee is not. Joe Lee thinks being a shapeshifter is \"special,\" but Sam assures him it has meant he's been alone all his life.||||| Lafayette tells Tara that Ruby has been a patient there for six months. She made him promise not to tell anyone. Lafayette showed her Ruby because \"there is darkness in this family.\" He thinks they are strong enough to rise above their suspect gene pool. Outside, Tommy and Sam compare notes for who had a more miserable life. Tommy wishes he had been sent away since Sam doesn't know what it was like to grow up with Melinda and Joe Lee. Eventually, they decide to go for a run and we see that Tommy shifts into a pit bull. Jessica calls about renting a chainsaw. She looks in her victim's wallet and sees a picture of him with a boy. She grabs his cash and leaves. Bill sits down to a formal dinner with King Russell and Talbot. Russell offers him a job as Sheriff of one of Mississippi's areas and says he is interested in marrying Queen Sophie to increase his kingdom. Sophie so far is refusing, and Russell would like Bill's help.||||| As Andy and Jason sit at Merlotte's, a glowing story about Andy comes on the TV. A drunken Jason stands up and toasts Andy. Jason seems upset that Andy is being treated like a hero for taking credit for his killing. Andy tells Jason he thinks he has potential. Jason tells Andy he is his best friend. During their run, Tommy stops in the middle of the road and barks at Sam. With a truck approaching, Sam runs over to Tommy.||||| Just before the truck runs them both over, Tommy turns into an owl and flies off. Sam misses being killed by inches and returns to his human shape, naked on the side of the road. An unseen man wearing boots rummages through drawers at Bill's house (?) and finds a hidden file on Sookie. Eric arrives at Sookie's place. Sitting on the porch, he tells her he and Godric found out back in the 1940s that the werewolves' master was a vampire. They had been hunting the pack of wolves, which are \"not ordinary werewolves\" and date back further than the Nazi party. The lycanthropes were well-trained and fueled by vampire blood. With Sookie in danger, Eric feels like he owes her. Eric wants her to invite him inside but she refuses.||||| Russell feels he has outgrown Mississippi and is interested in Louisiana's natural gas. Russell is aware Sophie has secrets and wants Bill to tell him what they are. When Bill refuses, Russell makes a threat towards Sookie. Terry reads Arlene a list of his positive qualities.

Just before going at it with the last wolf, Mississippi vampire king Russell Edgington rides up in hunting garb. He chastises one of the wolves for attacking Bill instead of kidnapping him as ordered. When Russell learns they fed on Bill, he shoots one of the two surviving wolves, and takes Bill back to his home. Lafayette frantically tries to make sure Tara throws up all of the pills she's taken in her suicide attempt. He yells at Lettie Mae for not paying attention to her daughter and takes Tara away with him. Sookie goes to see Eric about helping her find Bill. She shows him the runic brand they found on the dead werewolf. He tells her it's too dangerous for her to go poking around. In the bathroom, Pam is fixing her make-up and Jessica asks her how to feed on humans without killing them. She then wants to know how to dispose of one you've accidentally killed.||||| Sookie gets weepy, talking about Bill being missing, and tells Eric he owes her after she risked her life to help him find Godric. This emotion gets to Eric. As soon as Sookie leaves, Eric has a flashback to the 1940s. He and Godric watch an American soldier attempt to help a woman. She turns into a werewolf and kills the soldier. Eric and Godric jump out and pin the wolf to the wall. She yells that they are on the \"same side.\" When Eric sees the werewolf has one of the brands on her neck he says, \"No, we are not.' Russell brings Bill inside his stately residence. He is introduced to Russell's boyfriend, Talbot, and they show Bill to the luxurious room where he will be confined. On the way to the hospital, Tara assures Lafayette that she puked up all of the pills in her system. He tells her that Eggs \"would want you to live.\" When Tara doesn't seem so sure, Lafayette says he needs to show her something.||||| Sookie leaves Jessica at Bill's place, where Hoyt is waiting on the porch with a few bottles of True Blood. When Hoyt tells Jessica he knows what she was going through, being so hungry, she says he simply does not understand and storms inside crying. Inside she finds her rotting kill still in Bill's secret resting spot and climbs in with the corpse. At home, Sookie is surprised to find Jason. He tells her he's been having trouble sleeping and came over to do some cleaning. As they clean the kitchen Sookie tells Jason about the werewolves and the fact she feels helpless about Bill's disappearance. Jason thinks Andy might be able to help. Sam has fallen asleep at the wheel outside the Mickens residence. He is awakened by Tommy Mickens (who her had followed from the auto repair shop) pointing a shotgun in his face. Tommy brings Sam inside. When Sam tells his mother (Melinda) it's been 34 years since they've met, she knows right away who he is. She gives a look to husband Joe Lee who also seems to understand.||||| Sookie spots a werewolf staring at her from the woods near the bar. He disappears when Terry walks by, and the two search for clues. They find biker shoe prints and wolf prints, followed by a pair of discarded boots. Lafayette takes Tara to an institution. He tells the receptionist he wants to see Ruby Jean Reynolds, his mother. We see her in her room being fed by a young Latino orderly, Jesus. She is seriously delusional. Andy gives a statement to the press as Jason walks up to the station.||||| Andy isn't happy to see him and offers to take Jason out to lunch. Sookie tells Terry not to tell anyone about the man they saw. He gives her a revolver for protection. Sookie suggests he tell Arlene that he's \"good at things.\" Melinda tells Sam that Joe Lee was in prison when she had him. Melinda thought Sam would have a better life with another family. Joe Lee wasn't aware of Sam's existence until he had already been given away to the Merlottes. Sam learns that Melinda and Tommy are shapeshifters, but Joe Lee is not. Joe Lee thinks being a shapeshifter is \"special,\" but Sam assures him it has meant he's been alone all his life.||||| Lafayette tells Tara that Ruby has been a patient there for six months. She made him promise not to tell anyone. Lafayette showed her Ruby because \"there is darkness in this family.\" He thinks they are strong enough to rise above their suspect gene pool. Outside, Tommy and Sam compare notes for who had a more miserable life. Tommy wishes he had been sent away since Sam doesn't know what it was like to grow up with Melinda and Joe Lee. Eventually, they decide to go for a run and we see that Tommy shifts into a pit bull. Jessica calls about renting a chainsaw. She looks in her victim's wallet and sees a picture of him with a boy. She grabs his cash and leaves. Bill sits down to a formal dinner with King Russell and Talbot. Russell offers him a job as Sheriff of one of Mississippi's areas and says he is interested in marrying Queen Sophie to increase his kingdom. Sophie so far is refusing, and Russell would like Bill's help.||||| As Andy and Jason sit at Merlotte's, a glowing story about Andy comes on the TV. A drunken Jason stands up and toasts Andy. Jason seems upset that Andy is being treated like a hero for taking credit for his killing. Andy tells Jason he thinks he has potential. Jason tells Andy he is his best friend. During their run, Tommy stops in the middle of the road and barks at Sam. With a truck approaching, Sam runs over to Tommy.||||| Just before the truck runs them both over, Tommy turns into an owl and flies off. Sam misses being killed by inches and returns to his human shape, naked on the side of the road. An unseen man wearing boots rummages through drawers at Bill's house (?) and finds a hidden file on Sookie. Eric arrives at Sookie's place. Sitting on the porch, he tells her he and Godric found out back in the 1940s that the werewolves' master was a vampire. They had been hunting the pack of wolves, which are \"not ordinary werewolves\" and date back further than the Nazi party. The lycanthropes were well-trained and fueled by vampire blood. With Sookie in danger, Eric feels like he owes her. Eric wants her to invite him inside but she refuses.||||| Russell feels he has outgrown Mississippi and is interested in Louisiana's natural gas. Russell is aware Sophie has secrets and wants Bill to tell him what they are. When Bill refuses, Russell makes a threat towards Sookie. Terry reads Arlene a list of his positive qualities. A few moments in, she runs back to the bathroom to vomit. A dark figure enters Merlotte's and sits at the bar. He strikes up a conversation with Tara and orders a True Blood. His boots show that this is the man who was looking at Sookie's file. Jessica returns home to find her victim is missing. Andy drives Jason home from the bar.

She puts on her cheerleader outfit and goes downstairs to breakfast -- Jenna and her mom are there. It's sophomore year. She wakes up in the hospital. Meredith tells Jeremy that Elena is fine, she just has a slight concussion. Jeremy calls the Salvatores on the road. They can't believe Jeremy took her to the hospital when all the originals are looking to kill her to stop Alaric. One of them has to go back; the other has to deal with Klaus's desiccated body. Meredith returns to her office to find Alaric waiting for her. He takes her vials of vampire blood and dumps them out. He's reporting her to the medical board and Sheriff Forbes and Mayor Lockwood have been relieved of their duties. He wants Elena released into his custody. He goes to her room but finds she's gone.||||| Caroline, Matt and Tyler bring Elena home. Elena remembers sophomore year when she was with Matt. Bonnie has a bad feeling about the bonfire tonight. Jenna's in town and Elena's parents want to do family night. Matt tells her he loves her and Bonnie notices she doesn't say it back. She tells Elena not to string him along. Elena wakes up to Matt sitting watch. Tyler and Caroline got calls from their moms.||||| Elena apologizes to him for stringing him along and says she can't do the same thing to Damon and Stefan. Stefan comes in. Jeremy goes to pick up food at the Grille. Alaric finds him. Matt questions the wisdom of not getting Elena out of town, but Stefan is letting her decide what she wants to do. Elena goes to the door -- Elijah is there. At the Grille, Alaric asks Jeremy where Klaus' body is. Alaric wants Jeremy's help to find him and kill him to get rid of vampires. Once he's done, Alaric suggests they can put a spell on him so that Elena will be able to live out the rest of her life. The stake he has is the only thing that can kill them.||||| Elijah proposes he get the stake and his family will scatter for the rest of her life, prompting Alaric to follow them. He also wants Klaus' body and gives her his word he won't revive him within her or her children's lifetimes. They debate whether to trust him. Damon weighs in via speakerphone, firmly against the deal. Stefan defers to Elena. Elijah just wants his brother back. Elena agrees. Matt and Caroline go to the Lockwoods where their moms tell them Alaric outed them to the council. They want them to run. Jeremy tells Matt about Alaric's proposal. Jeremy doesn't know where Klaus' body is, but Matt does. Jeremy calls Alaric and tells him Damon's taking him to bury him in the woods. Jeremy gets off the phone and we see everyone is in the room with him. He reports that Alaric bought it. Tyler thinks they should go and Caroline is willing to run with him, but she wants to help their friends first. They make plans to meet in two hours.||||| Damon meets up with Bonnie, irked that Elena sold their souls to the originals. \"You know what else was her call? Everything bad, ever,\" he says. Damon has him in a coffin in a storage facility. Bonnie's there to put a spell on him so Alaric can't find him with a witch. Bonnie asks for a moment alone with him. Klaus is conscious, but can't talk. She hates him for turning almost everyone she knows. Elena worries about Jeremy and Stefan assures her he'll be fine. Elena starts to say something else, but tells him they can talk later. He thinks about it then goes back and kisses her. \"That's just in case there is no 'later,'\" he says. Damon hangs out with the body, waiting for Rebekah to come get him. Caroline and Elijah are in place; Jeremy's going to lead Alaric to them. Damon can't believe Stefan let Elena decide.||||| Damon hears someone coming and thinks it's Rebekah. But instead Alaric grabs him around the throat. \"You'd be surprised how competent law enforcement is when it isn't corrupted by vampires,\" he says. He asks where Klaus is. Damon wishes him luck finding him in the thousands of storage lockers. Alaric snaps Damon's neck. Matt brings Elena tea. It tastes funny, he blames it on honey. \"So, Stefan?\" Matt says. Elena tells Matt, for the first time, that Stefan saved her life when her parents' car went over the bridge. Being with Stefan helped her sort through everything after they died. She says you should love the person who makes you glad to be alive, but when she's with Damon, he consumes her. She doesn't want to chose one and lose the other. She wishes her mom was there to give her advice. Back to sophomore year, Elena calls home for a ride home from the bonfire. She tells her mom about getting in a fight with Matt because he brought up marriage and college. She doesn't want to lose Matt by being honest about her feelings, but her mom says she'd be setting him free.||||| Elena wakes up in a moving car. Matt drugged her and is taking her out of town. Alaric goes searching through storage lockers. Rebekah arrives. She goes walking among the storage lockers calling for Damon. Suddenly a hand clamps around her mouth. Damon shushes her. Alaric comes to the 1020 locker the coffin was in. He opens it. The coffin isn't there. Rebekah and Damon wheel the coffin out but don't get far before they fun into Alaric. He grabs Rebekah and slams her face off a car. She goes down. Damon attacks but he kicks him to the ground. With Rebekah and Damon both down for the count, Alaric opens Klaus' coffin. He stakes Klaus. Damon holds Rebekah back as she screams. Klaus bursts into flames. Damon tells her to run. He tries to take on Alaric, but Alaric swats him away. Later, Damon calls Stefan. They both feel OK. They figure they have about an hour if Klaus was telling the truth. Stefan says an hour isn't long enough for Damon to make it back to Mystic Falls -- to see Elena. He thinks she made her choice.||||| Jeremy confesses that Elena isn't in Mystic Falls. Elijah and Caroline show up. Matt gets a call about the news. Elena wants to go back, but Matt tells her Damon isn't with them. She has to pick which way to go. Elena calls Damon, who still feels fine. She tells him Matt's taking her home -- to Stefan, Tyler and Caroline. Damon asks her who she'd pick between him and Stefan. She loves Stefan and whatever she feels for Damon, she can't change how she feels about Stefan. She says maybe if she'd met Damon first.... She has to let Damon go, but he'll be fine and see him soon. Damon turns around and sees Alaric standing there. He calmly says good-bye to her. Alaric punches him. Caroline races to the cellar and meets Tyler. She's sobbing and crying and breaks the news to him about Klaus. He tells she'll be fine and to tell his mother that he left town like he was supposed to.||||| He's holding on to her as he starts coughing and is gripped with pain. Caroline feels fine. He wants her to leave so she doesn't see him die, he starts to turn into a werewolf and runs her off. Elena gets the call about Tyler. Matt takes it hard. Rebekah meets Elijah in the woods. Rebekah is sure that Klaus turned that bloodline, so they don't understand how everyone else is still alive. Bonnie goes down to the cellar looking for someone. Tyler walks out, fine. \"I must say you really did that spell brilliantly, I didn't think you had it in you,\" he says. \"I did it to save my friends and my mother, Klaus,\" she says. (Klaus!) Rebekah calls Stefan, since Klaus is dead, their deal is off. She doesn't want to keep running. The only way to stop Alaric is for Elena to die. Cut to Elena and Matt driving back into town over the Wickery Bridge. Rebekah stands in their path. Matt serves to avoid her and they go off the bridge into the river.||||| Elena wakes up in sophomore year, with her dad in the front seat. He tells her they're going to be fine, right as she sinks underwater. Alaric beats up on Damon, who refuses to fight back. Alaric thinks his friendship with Damon made him weak. Damon remembers that same bonfire night, seeing Elena on the phone. He goes over and talks to her, thinking she's Katherine. She tells him she got into a fight with her boyfriend over the future. He says she knows what she wants, a love that consumes her, passion, adventure and even a little danger. She asks what he wants, but her parents drive up. He compels her to forget they ever met, saying he can't have people know he's in town yet. Alaric continues beating on Damon and then kneels down with his stake. He starts to drive it in, but Damon fights back. Elena wakes up in the car underwater. She remembers the last time she was there with her parents as she struggles to wake Matt up and break the window.||||| She mouthed \"I love you\" to her dad underwater and passed out. Stefan swam down and her dad pointed at her for Stefan to save her first. In the present, Stefan swims down again and Elena points at Matt for Stefan to save him first. He resists but she's insistent. Stefan swims away with Matt leaving Elena underwater. Damon is fighting Alaric when suddenly Alaric grabs at his chest, weak. He starts to turn grey. Damon realizes what's happened and holds on to him.||||| Jeremy leaves a message for Matt and comes downstairs to see Alaric standing there. It's good Ric. He wanted to say good-bye and there he was. He tells Jeremy he'll never be alone. Jeremy realizes Alaric is a ghost. But then that means Elena.... Cut to Elena, dead. Stefan cries over her. Damon races in to the hospital. Meredith stops him. She tells him when Jeremy brought her in earlier her injuries were much worse than she let on. Elena had a cerebral hemorrhage. \"I helped her, she needed my help,\" Meredith says pointedly. \"You what?!\" Damon says. Damon realizes what Meredith is saying. Elena had vampire blood in her system. And then she died.

Meredith tells Jeremy that Elena is fine, she just has a slight concussion. Jeremy calls the Salvatores on the road. They can't believe Jeremy took her to the hospital when all the originals are looking to kill her to stop Alaric. One of them has to go back; the other has to deal with Klaus's desiccated body. Meredith returns to her office to find Alaric waiting for her. He takes her vials of vampire blood and dumps them out. He's reporting her to the medical board and Sheriff Forbes and Mayor Lockwood have been relieved of their duties. He wants Elena released into his custody. He goes to her room but finds she's gone.||||| Caroline, Matt and Tyler bring Elena home. Elena remembers sophomore year when she was with Matt. Bonnie has a bad feeling about the bonfire tonight. Jenna's in town and Elena's parents want to do family night. Matt tells her he loves her and Bonnie notices she doesn't say it back. She tells Elena not to string him along. Elena wakes up to Matt sitting watch. Tyler and Caroline got calls from their moms.||||| Elena apologizes to him for stringing him along and says she can't do the same thing to Damon and Stefan. Stefan comes in. Jeremy goes to pick up food at the Grille. Alaric finds him. Matt questions the wisdom of not getting Elena out of town, but Stefan is letting her decide what she wants to do. Elena goes to the door -- Elijah is there. At the Grille, Alaric asks Jeremy where Klaus' body is. Alaric wants Jeremy's help to find him and kill him to get rid of vampires. Once he's done, Alaric suggests they can put a spell on him so that Elena will be able to live out the rest of her life. The stake he has is the only thing that can kill them.||||| Elijah proposes he get the stake and his family will scatter for the rest of her life, prompting Alaric to follow them. He also wants Klaus' body and gives her his word he won't revive him within her or her children's lifetimes. They debate whether to trust him. Damon weighs in via speakerphone, firmly against the deal. Stefan defers to Elena. Elijah just wants his brother back. Elena agrees. Matt and Caroline go to the Lockwoods where their moms tell them Alaric outed them to the council. They want them to run. Jeremy tells Matt about Alaric's proposal. Jeremy doesn't know where Klaus' body is, but Matt does. Jeremy calls Alaric and tells him Damon's taking him to bury him in the woods. Jeremy gets off the phone and we see everyone is in the room with him. He reports that Alaric bought it. Tyler thinks they should go and Caroline is willing to run with him, but she wants to help their friends first. They make plans to meet in two hours.||||| Damon meets up with Bonnie, irked that Elena sold their souls to the originals. \"You know what else was her call? Everything bad, ever,\" he says. Damon has him in a coffin in a storage facility. Bonnie's there to put a spell on him so Alaric can't find him with a witch. Bonnie asks for a moment alone with him. Klaus is conscious, but can't talk. She hates him for turning almost everyone she knows. Elena worries about Jeremy and Stefan assures her he'll be fine. Elena starts to say something else, but tells him they can talk later. He thinks about it then goes back and kisses her. \"That's just in case there is no 'later,'\" he says. Damon hangs out with the body, waiting for Rebekah to come get him. Caroline and Elijah are in place; Jeremy's going to lead Alaric to them. Damon can't believe Stefan let Elena decide.||||| Damon hears someone coming and thinks it's Rebekah. But instead Alaric grabs him around the throat. \"You'd be surprised how competent law enforcement is when it isn't corrupted by vampires,\" he says. He asks where Klaus is. Damon wishes him luck finding him in the thousands of storage lockers. Alaric snaps Damon's neck. Matt brings Elena tea. It tastes funny, he blames it on honey. \"So, Stefan?\" Matt says. Elena tells Matt, for the first time, that Stefan saved her life when her parents' car went over the bridge. Being with Stefan helped her sort through everything after they died. She says you should love the person who makes you glad to be alive, but when she's with Damon, he consumes her. She doesn't want to chose one and lose the other. She wishes her mom was there to give her advice. Back to sophomore year, Elena calls home for a ride home from the bonfire. She tells her mom about getting in a fight with Matt because he brought up marriage and college. She doesn't want to lose Matt by being honest about her feelings, but her mom says she'd be setting him free.||||| Elena wakes up in a moving car. Matt drugged her and is taking her out of town. Alaric goes searching through storage lockers. Rebekah arrives. She goes walking among the storage lockers calling for Damon. Suddenly a hand clamps around her mouth. Damon shushes her. Alaric comes to the 1020 locker the coffin was in. He opens it. The coffin isn't there. Rebekah and Damon wheel the coffin out but don't get far before they fun into Alaric. He grabs Rebekah and slams her face off a car. She goes down. Damon attacks but he kicks him to the ground. With Rebekah and Damon both down for the count, Alaric opens Klaus' coffin. He stakes Klaus. Damon holds Rebekah back as she screams. Klaus bursts into flames. Damon tells her to run. He tries to take on Alaric, but Alaric swats him away. Later, Damon calls Stefan. They both feel OK. They figure they have about an hour if Klaus was telling the truth. Stefan says an hour isn't long enough for Damon to make it back to Mystic Falls -- to see Elena. He thinks she made her choice.||||| Jeremy confesses that Elena isn't in Mystic Falls. Elijah and Caroline show up. Matt gets a call about the news. Elena wants to go back, but Matt tells her Damon isn't with them. She has to pick which way to go. Elena calls Damon, who still feels fine. She tells him Matt's taking her home -- to Stefan, Tyler and Caroline. Damon asks her who she'd pick between him and Stefan. She loves Stefan and whatever she feels for Damon, she can't change how she feels about Stefan. She says maybe if she'd met Damon first.... She has to let Damon go, but he'll be fine and see him soon. Damon turns around and sees Alaric standing there. He calmly says good-bye to her. Alaric punches him. Caroline races to the cellar and meets Tyler. She's sobbing and crying and breaks the news to him about Klaus. He tells she'll be fine and to tell his mother that he left town like he was supposed to.||||| He's holding on to her as he starts coughing and is gripped with pain. Caroline feels fine. He wants her to leave so she doesn't see him die, he starts to turn into a werewolf and runs her off. Elena gets the call about Tyler. Matt takes it hard. Rebekah meets Elijah in the woods. Rebekah is sure that Klaus turned that bloodline, so they don't understand how everyone else is still alive. Bonnie goes down to the cellar looking for someone. Tyler walks out, fine. \"I must say you really did that spell brilliantly, I didn't think you had it in you,\" he says. \"I did it to save my friends and my mother, Klaus,\" she says. (Klaus!) Rebekah calls Stefan, since Klaus is dead, their deal is off. She doesn't want to keep running. The only way to stop Alaric is for Elena to die. Cut to Elena and Matt driving back into town over the Wickery Bridge. Rebekah stands in their path. Matt serves to avoid her and they go off the bridge into the river.||||| Elena wakes up in sophomore year, with her dad in the front seat. He tells her they're going to be fine, right as she sinks underwater. Alaric beats up on Damon, who refuses to fight back. Alaric thinks his friendship with Damon made him weak. Damon remembers that same bonfire night, seeing Elena on the phone. He goes over and talks to her, thinking she's Katherine. She tells him she got into a fight with her boyfriend over the future. He says she knows what she wants, a love that consumes her, passion, adventure and even a little danger. She asks what he wants, but her parents drive up. He compels her to forget they ever met, saying he can't have people know he's in town yet. Alaric continues beating on Damon and then kneels down with his stake. He starts to drive it in, but Damon fights back. Elena wakes up in the car underwater. She remembers the last time she was there with her parents as she struggles to wake Matt up and break the window.||||| She mouthed \"I love you\" to her dad underwater and passed out. Stefan swam down and her dad pointed at her for Stefan to save her first. In the present, Stefan swims down again and Elena points at Matt for Stefan to save him first. He resists but she's insistent. Stefan swims away with Matt leaving Elena underwater. Damon is fighting Alaric when suddenly Alaric grabs at his chest, weak. He starts to turn grey. Damon realizes what's happened and holds on to him.||||| Jeremy leaves a message for Matt and comes downstairs to see Alaric standing there. It's good Ric. He wanted to say good-bye and there he was. He tells Jeremy he'll never be alone. Jeremy realizes Alaric is a ghost. But then that means Elena.... Cut to Elena, dead. Stefan cries over her. Damon races in to the hospital. Meredith stops him. She tells him when Jeremy brought her in earlier her injuries were much worse than she let on. Elena had a cerebral hemorrhage. \"I helped her, she needed my help,\" Meredith says pointedly. \"You what?!\" Damon says. Damon realizes what Meredith is saying. Elena had vampire blood in her system. And then she died.

Jessica denies the allegations that she is any negative influence over her husband, while Pike makes a phone cal to the house to talk with Ernest Valdemar, who speaks over the phone in a weak but coherent voice explaining about his decision to let Jessica take control of his money and assets from his personal signature on the written documents that she has. Pike reluctantly agress to let Jessica have access to the money, but wearns her that if antything were to happen of Mr. Valdemar within the next three before the transfer of his estate over to Jessica is finalized, she will be investigated by the authorities.||||| Jessica returns home to Ernest Valdemar's large suburban mansion where she meets with Dr. Robert Hoffman where it is revealed that he and Jessica have been conspiring to cheat the terminally ill Mr. Valdemar out of his estate hypnotining him and and having him do what they wish from his deathbed. Jessica dosen't like the procedure, but Robert wants it done because he used to have a romance with Jessica and wants to run off with her after they acquire his $3 million assets. The next day, Jessica goes to a bank where she withdraws $3000,000 and stores it in a safe. Robert sees this. But then, Mr. Valdemar goes into cardiac arrest and dies while under another hypnosis spell. Not wanting to reveal his death just yet, Robert and Jessica carry his body to the basement where they hide it in a freezer. But during the night, Jessica becomes frightened when she hears moaning coming from the basement, but when she tries to wake up Robert, he has put himself under a hypnotic-induced slumber to help him sleep.||||| The next morning, Jessica and Robert wake up and also hear the same noises coming from the basement. Upon checking body, they hear Ernest Valdemar's voice coming from the still body claiming that this soul is alive and trapped in a dark void between the living and the dead while under hypnosis. Vlaldemar tells them that he sees \"others\" in the dark void looking at him.||||| While Jessica goes out to make sense of this situation, she returns to find Robert talking to Mr. Valdemar's undead corpse who tells him that the \"other\" are vengeful spirits trapped in a realm and want to use him to enter our world. Valdemar tells Robert to wake him up and free him from his hypnotic state. In a panic, Jessica shoots Valdemar's corpse and wants to bury the body and skip town with the money they have. While Robert heads outside to dig a hole to bury the body, Jessica goes back into the cellar only to find Valdemar's body rising up out of the freezer and walking towards her saying that he is under control of \"the others\" to use him. Jessica shoots him, but he keepson coming. Robert enters the house when he hears the gunshots and sees Jessica and Valdemar struggling on the balcony where the undead walking cadaver shoots Jessica in the head and she falls off the balcony, dead.||||| Robert finally tells Valdemar that he's going to wake him and free from his hypnosis. But after doing so by counting to five, Valdemar tells Robert that it's too late to wake him, for without his body as a conduit, the Others cannot return to their realm. \"They're with you now!\" exclaims Valdemar, who finally falls dead. Robert then steals all the cash that Jessica had stored in the safe and flees the house.||||| Robert goes back to his apartment in downtown Pittsburgh, where he puts himself under a hypnotic sleep. Shortly after, the ghostly \"Others\" enter his apartment and kill him by shoving the hypnotic digital counter into his chest. The ghosts then form themselves into one large mass-like mist and enter Robert's dead body. Several days later, the police led by Detective Grogan arrive at Robert's apartment to answer complaints about a \"strange smell\" and constant moaning coming from the apartment. Grogan finds the apartment ransacked and the stolen cash scattered everywhere. But just then, the horribly decomposed body of Robert, under the control of the Others, appears and attacks Grogan, while telling him that there is nobody to wake him up and that he is trapped forever.||||| Rod Usher makes his entrance in a building decorated with the abject remains of dismantled corpses. A naked woman lies bound to a table, sliced in two by a huge pendulum-like blade. Rod is a professional crime scene photographer for as he puts it: \"still life's my art,\" a talent which ensures that he is frequently called upon the local authorities--led by Detective LeGrand--to document the horrors of the baroque crime scenes which are apparently commonplace in Pittsburgh where Rod lives.||||| After arriving home at a semi-fancy row house, Rod works in his darkroom in the basement developing the photos when his work is interrupted by the appearance of a mysterious black cat, which has apparently been adopted by his live-in girlfriend Annabel. Rod and Annabel's relationship is uncomfortably distant. Annabel is delicate, sensitive, and somewhat ethereal, while Rod is a rough, burly, brutish man who seem more at home with the gritty hyper-reality of crime scenes that he is with Annabel's talk of witches and superstition. Annabel, in contrast to Rod, is a professional violinist who gives private lessons to local high school students who show up at the house after their school classes, and she even takes some of them on excursions to local opera houses to watch the arts of life.||||| Over the next several days, a strong antipathy grows between Rod and the mysterious cat, a situation worsened by Annabel's excessive protection of it. Driven to distraction by the cat's apparent hatred of him, Rod eventually strangles it during a photo shoot he has set up with the cat being the center of attention. Rod then uses the photos of him strangling the cat to post on the cover of his newest photography book, titled Metropolitan Horrors , a lurid collection of his most revolting pictures.||||| As Annabel begins to guess the truth about what has happened to her pet, the couple embarks on a series of violent arguments, one of which ends with Rod falling into an alcohol-induced sleep where he has a nightmare about participating in a Medieval Pagan festival where he's executed for the murder of the cat. One day, when Annabel finally spots his book in a shop window, with the strangled body of her much-loved cat on the front cover, she immediately goes home and makes plans to leave Rod.||||| Meanwhile, Rod is drinking heavily at a local bar. He becomes unnerved when the barmaid, Eleonora, gives him a stray black cat, which is identical to Annabel's own cat. Rod notices that the inky feline has an identical white marking on its chest (an obscure white patch which seems to resemble the shape of a gallows). Rod brings the cat home and sets about to kill the feline once and for all. But Annabel intervenes and comes to the cat's rescue, causing a confrontation which ends in her gruesome death when Rod hacks her with a meat cleaver. After shaking off his suspicious next door neighbor and landlord, Mr. Pym, who arrives after hearing the argument, Rod assures him that nothing is wrong.||||| Confident that he can escape detection, Rod conceals the body behind a wall in the house and invents a story to explain Annabel's disappearance to her music students, Betty and Christian, when they show up the next day for their violin lessons. But after a confrontation with Christian, who expresses doubt and suspicion to Rod about his story of Annabel leaving him, she confides in Mr. and Mrs. Pym about her suspicions that Rod might have killed Annabel. When Annabel's friend in New York keeps phoning the house to ask about her whereabouts, Rod becomes increasingly trapped by his own increasing elaborate web of lies. The situation is exacerbated by yet another appearance of the black cat from behind the wall. But this time, Rod ensures its death by slicing it in two with a saw, and disposes of it in a garbage dump.||||| The next day, Detective LeGrand arrives with his partner to question Rod about Annabel's whereabouts. Despite their stern questioning, Rod isn't fazed by these questions. After looking around the house, the detectives leave, but immediately come back when an eerie, distorted mewing sound is heard echoing though one of the walls.||||| Rod is handcuffed and the fake wall he put up is torn down and his crime scene is gruesomely revealed: the ever troublesome feline had given birth in Annabel's tomb and its offspring are now feasting on the remains of their mistress. Not to be outdone, Rod grabs the pick-axe from LeGrand's partner and in seconds kills both policemen. Handcuffed and in panic, Rod tries to make his escape when his neighbors show up after hearing the commotion, pounding on the front door. Rod attempts to flee from his house by climbing out a second floor window by using a rope to tie around a tree in his backyard. But his plan fails when he gets tangled in the rope and slips, the rope tightening around his neck, asphyxiating and killing him.

Xander goofs around pretending to be a pirate, Dawn looks for stuff to take, Anya roller-skates around selling things, while Willow argues with a woman who is dressed as a stereotypical witch . Buffy runs into Spike in the basement, and the two have an awkward conversation in which Buffy thinks Spike is trying to get her into bed, but then he clarifies that he wants to go patrolling with her that night, notwithstanding the fact that supernatural forces typically don't operate on Halloween. The gang, who have been helping out all day, are worn out. Anya dances with Dawn as she counts her money. Xander looks at her, and decides that the time has finally arrived to announce that he and Anya are engaged. The gang wishes the couple well but privately share their concerns with each other. As Anya gushes about wedding plans and being married, Xander starts to look uncomfortable.||||| The gang throws an impromptu party at Buffy's house for the two. When the lack of decorations is mentioned, Willow uses a spell to fill the room with them. While Anya is grateful, Tara and Giles share a concerned look.. Later in the kitchen Tara tries to talk to Willow about her casual and increasingly excessive use of magic, while Willow fails to see anything wrong with doing so. Dawn reminds Buffy that she is spending the night at her friend Janice 's house. After Buffy approves, Dawn heads out to meet Janice for what is actually planned to be an evening of Halloween fun and teenage hijinks with two older boys named Zack and Justin. As Dawn, Janice, Zack, and Justin engage in some of the more violent Halloween pranks, breaking windows and damaging mailboxes, back at Buffy's place, Giles and Xander share a drink and talk about Xander's future. Xander almost seems to second-guess his marriage intentions and his future. Giles assures him that everything will be fine.||||| Dawn and friends find themselves in front of Old Man Kaltenbach 's house, Kaltenbach being reclusive and subject to rumor. After Janice refuses to approach the house, Dawn then bravely volunteers. As she lifts his pumpkin to smash it, the old man grabs her. Dawn's pals quickly rush her aid, but they are cheerily invited into the house. As it turns out, the man was actually a toy maker who is merely bitter about his toys becoming obsolete. Justin offers to help the old man with his special treat in the kitchen. As he prepares rice crispy treats for the kids, Justin vamps out, kills the old man, and steals his wallet. Zach and Justin debate whether to just eat Janice and Dawn, or turn them into vampires, too. Justin gives Dawn $10--her portion of the money stolen from Kaltenbach, which she accepts without hesitation. Justin is impressed when Dawn tells him she has been stealing for a long time.||||| Janice's mom calls Buffy's house and Giles figures out that Dawn has tricked them. He goes off to find Buffy; Anya, and Xander mind the house; and Tara and Willow head for the Bronze . Zack steals a car by killing the driver and the four teens begin making out. Janice and Zack then take off, leaving Dawn and Justin alone in the car. Justin then takes the opportunity to make his move and deliver Dawn her very first kiss. At the Bronze, Tara and Willow get into a fight when Willow proposes to magically shift everyone who isn't a 15 year old girl old into an alternate dimension to make Dawn easier to find. After Tara calls Willow out, Willow gets very angry and accuses Tara of taking Giles's side. In Zack's stolen car, Dawn and Justin continue to make out. However, after Justin nibbles her lip a little too hard, he vamps out. Although Dawn is swept away in the moment, she manages to feel his lumpy noggin. Nearby, Buffy smashes the door in on Spike's crypt . He informs her of Dawn and her antics. Buffy grabs a pistol crossbow out of his weapons chest.||||| In the cemetery, Giles hears a girl scream and races to save her, thinking it's Dawn. Instead, he finds Zack and Janice, just as Zack pulls his teeth out of her neck. Zack calls Giles \"grandpa\" and tells him Janice was asking for it. The Watcher scoffs that he's certain she was not, and then dusts him. He continues to look for Dawn. Meanwhile, Dawn has just run out of the car to get away from the vampire.

{"Prompt": "Suppose you are a story-reteller, generate a list of main concepts to help me understand the story.\n\nStory: Devil ( Kevin Rankin ) paces on a front porch of a nice home while Tanner Dodd ( Brendan McCarthy ) tells him to relax. The \"boss\" is on his way. Enter Quarles stepping onto the porch with a broad smile. \"You must be the one they call 'Devil,'\" he says. Inside, Quarles explains that Tanner is a \"talent scout\" -- and has scouted Devil, who isn't exactly thrilled with how Boyd has treated him. \"You got something better?\" Devil asks. Quarles assures Devil that, yes, he does, and promises him a one-time only offer of improving his standard of living. In the prison yard, Dickie and Dewey are taking severe beatings at the hands of their fellow inmates. Moments later, they are taken to the infirmary, where corrupt guard Ash Murphy rages. Dewey wasn't supposed to be part of this \"plan.\" Lance ( Clayne Crawford ), the prison medic who is also in on the escape plan, jabs Dewey in the neck with a needle. Dewey goes limp. Problem solved... for now.||||| Later, Givens arrives at the prison to question Lance, who explains that he was injured when Dickie escaped in a coroner's van. The van is parked on the side of a rural road as Ash approaches driver Edward Fowler ( Ethan Wilde )... and shoots him dead where he sits. He then opens the back of the van to reveal the body bags containing Dickie, Dewey and an actual deceased inmate. Ash explains that he and Dickie will go after Mags' money while Dewey goes with Lance to hide out at a nearby motel.||||| Neither escapee is overly pleased. Givens then visits Loretta ( Kaitlyn Dever ), who notes that she has a few friends in her new life as a babysitter. After some banter, Givens asks about Mags' stash of money. Loretta thinks she might know where ol' Mags might just have kept that stash. Later, following Loretta's tip, Givens and Rachel arrive at Limehouse's enclave looking for Dickie, who they suspect is after his mom's money. The pair spar with Limehouse, who isn't about to give up any information. He does, however, invite the Marshals to a barbeque. \"I'm going to hook you up with some bacon you ain't never going to forget,\" Limehouse coos to Rachel, who is unimpressed.||||| Givens drives away... and is spotted by Dickie and Ash, who are parked nearby waiting to get past the police check point to the bridge into Limehouse's holler. Ash is furious to see the law, but Dickie doesn't appear to be too terribly surprised. Ash directs that, if they can't approach Limehouse directly, then Dickie will have to find a way to get the money. They repair to the motel where Dewey and Lance are holed up with the taciturn Combs ( Ed Corbin ) and his dimwit son Junior ( Adam Bartley ) who have a grudge against the Bennetts because of Mags' \"sell-out\" to the mining company. Dickie tries to call Limehouse. After one failed attempt to make contact because of caution by Limehouse's man, a connection is made after Dickie assures Limehouse that he \"knows how to talk\" on a 'phone. \"I assume you are aware of the situation up here,\" Limehouse says in reference to the police presence. Dickie is aware, which is why he needs Limehouse to personally deliver the \"package.\"||||| Devil returns to Johnny's recently reclaimed bar where Boyd hands him a small stack of bills. Devil, thinking of Quarles's proposition, wonders when Boyd plans to execute a big score. Boyd dismisses Devil, telling his flunky to be patient. Devil scowls. Then Givens enters. He inquires regarding the whereabouts of his own father and then tells the story of the night his mother finally left after years of abuse. Givens was just a boy. Mom ran to Limehouse territory, Nobles Hollow, where white women sometimes went for shelter because they knew their men wouldn't follow. Well, a drunken Arlo did follow, only to be \"felled\" by a young Limehouse when he tried to land a haymaker to the man. \"He beat him so bad that I had to drag him back to the car and drive him home myself,\" Givens concludes before revealing that he had just visited Limehouse today. Boyd wonders why such a visit occurred. Givens explains that Dickie and Dewey escaped prison. Boyd suggests that Givens take a closer look at the prison medic.||||| Later, Devil corners Johnny, asking about the low payment from Boyd. Devil reminds Johnny that he is in a wheelchair because of Boyd. \"There was a time I believed in Boyd Crowder,\" Devil says. \"But the man we have today is not that Boyd. Not by a long shot.\" Devil then tells Johnny about the Quarles deal. Givens, in the meantime, is parked outside the motel hideout after his tip from Boyd. He looks up to see Ash crossing the parking lot with a box full of coffee and take-out lunches. Ash stops dead in his tracks. The two stare at each other. Then Ash drops the food and reaches for his gun. Givens slams on the gas pedal and the car hurtles forward into Ash, knocking him down. When the guard somehow manages to stand and awkwardly start shooting, Givens throws the car into reverse, hitting him again. Givens then goes inside the motel room to find a cigarette still burning, but no escapees. Just then, a van peels out of the motel parking lot, closely followed by a car. Lance, Dickie, Dewey and the Combs, father and son, have left the scene.||||| Givens then extracts info from the seriously injured Ash. The plan is for Limehouse to bring Mags' money to her old store, where Dickie will meet him. Givens calls Rachel, who reports that she has just turned around a truck full of pig manure at the police check point and sent it back into the holler, and that she hasn't let any traffic out of Limehouse's holler. Realizing that Mags' money will not be delivered and that Dickie might just die because of that, Givens curses as he suspects that he now might have to save Dickie Bennett. Dickie, meanwhile, is forced into his mom's old store at gunpoint by the Combs father and son. The place has been trashed. Dickie begins looking behind the wall for the money and pulls out a battered cooler. He slowly lifts the lid when there is a pair of blasts. Ash's accomplices fall dead... and out steps Limehouse who took an old underground railroad trail to evade the police checkpoint at the bridge.||||| Overjoyed, Dickie opens the cooler to reveal a measly amount of cash, $46,313 to be precise. \"There was supposed to be $3 million in there!\" Dickie exclaims. Limehouse calmly explains that it was spent by Mags to buy up surrounding property, and that there are receipts for everything. Dickie, who suspects Limehouse, pushes away the money. He refuses to accept that amount. Dickie only asks for a shotgun, and Limehouse directs his associate to unload his and give it to Dickie. \"Are you good with this, Mr. Bennett?\" asks Limehouse. Dickie just laughs in disbelief. After Limehouse exits with his cohort, Givens pulls up to the store to hear shotgun blasts. He enters to find Dickie sitting inside. The escapee has been firing off random shots. \"I hereby surrender,\" Dickie says. \"To be very clear, I am the victim here,\" and Givens agrees, and wonders where Dewey might be.||||| Dewey has been taped to a chair in a hotel room by the medic. Lance then wheels Dickie past a long row of surgical tools. He spreads a tarp on the bed. Dewey screams -- and Lance again injects him. Once more, Dewey goes limp. The medic then calls someone on his cell. \"I may have a way for us to make some more money.\" Back at Johnny's bar, Devil and Johnny approach Boyd. Devil explains that this particular conversation has been a longtime coming.||||| Devil then pulls a gun and aims it at Boyd who feigns resignation and regret, then asks for a final indulgence from his wouldbe executioner, one last question. \"Whatever led you in your imagination to believe you could pull this off?\" Johnny then puts a gun on Devil, whose mouth drops open. Boyd rises, gun in hand, and shoots Devil in the chest. \"All I ever asked for was your loyalty,\" Boyd whispers to the stricken man who have pledged his loyalty, then reneged. \"Hurts, don't it,\" Boyd says. \"I know, I've been there, too.

Both are mad at their friends and at themselves for meeting each other again, but when Joey gives Chandler his credit card so that he can leave with his date, things take a forward step. What Chandler doesn't foresee is that he ends up sleeping with Janice. This new relationship does not last long, as he breaks up with her the next day at the coffee house; however, she's fine with this, because she knows Chandler will keep looking for her as he probably loves her, and he calls after her \"Call me!\" as she leaves the coffee house. Janice has had candy hearts printed with \"Chan and Jan Forever.\"||||| Ross also gets a date--his first one since his divorce with Carol --with a beautiful neighbor of his named Kristen. Unfortunately for Ross, Carol and Susan also dine at the same Japanese restaurant and are seated at the same grill table. Ross focuses his attention on Carol rather than his date. When Susan leaves on an emergency, Ross insists that Carol move to his end of the table. His date, Kristen, already uncomfortable with her date's ex at the same table, slips away, leaving Ross alone with Carol. The two reminisce about the good times they had together and share a kiss.||||| However, Carol points out how things have changed, and consoles Ross by assuring him that he'll soon meet someone right for him soon. Phoebe , Rachel and Monica spend the holiday burning mementos of their past boyfriends, including Rachel's Pete Carney, who always cried after sex, and Monica's Howard, the \"I Win!\" guy. However, things get out of control as Rachel pours Paolo's remaining grappa in the bonfire, which almost burns the apartment. The fire, in a way, is a good omen, as the girls get three attractive firemen putting out the fire and asking them for drinks at the end of their shift.

Van Buren claims that he was trying to rob her with another young man, but doubt is cast on her story as he was unarmed and shot in the back. Despite being ordered not to, Logan and Briscoe investigate the supposed robbery while McCoy takes Van Buren to the grand jury with a murder indictment.||||| Despite McCoy going after her aggressively and claiming she may have been frustrated that more non-white kids being arrested than white kids, the jury ultimately doesn't indict her, but McCoy believes it is because they want her on the streets stopping people committing crimes by any means necessary. As a result of the shooting, Van Buren is ordered to see Doctor Olivet and she believes that killing James was a mistake, but is also angered that after all she has done in her 12 year career she is starting to lose everything. Briscoe and Logan come up with a theory based on Van Buren's story of what might've happened: the second kid, the one with the gun faces off with Van Buren who pulls her gun and shoots him in a non-fatal spot like the arm or the leg, but the bullet goes through the limb and kills James.||||| Briscoe and Logan check into hospital records and find a kid who got shot in the arm and took off before the cops could check it out. They find out that he used the alias of a dead gangbanger who was pretty popular. The two speak to Detective Brian Keene who had arrested the gangbanger several times and confirms that he's still popular enough that several kids might use his name as an alias. Keene points them to where those kids would hang out and they spot a kid with an arm wound named Zack Rowland and arrest him. While he confirms that he and James did try to rob Van Buren, he claims they were unarmed and tried to rob through intimidation and she went crazy and started shooting. They are unable to locate Zack's gun, but with the help of James' girlfriend Gwen, they find it and it matches Van Buren's description of the gun pulled on her, seemingly proving her story. They also learn that Zack's brother stole it and sold it to him which strengthens their case.||||| McCoy charges Zack with murder for his part in James' death who had a very low IQ and according to his teacher and Doctor Ollivet's assessment of him, didn't have the mental capacity to plan the robbery with the teacher believing he was likely tricked into it, believing it was a game. McCoy hides that James needed money to buy Gwen an ID bracelet and had \"a way\" of getting it which could prove that he was willingly in on the robbery, but the defense finds out and puts her on the stand. However, McCoy and Kincaid recall that the teacher had told them that James had needed her help to learn how to write Gwen's name and it would be printed on the bracelet, but he'd gotten the help some time before his death.||||| Realizing that James may have already gotten the bracelet which would negate his motive for committing robbery, McCoy sends Van Buren to ask James' mother about the bracelet. Mrs. Gordon refuses to help Van Buren as she killed her son, but when Van Buren reveals her immense guilt over his death and asks her to help prevent more kids from dying on the streets, the mother reveals that James did buy the bracelet, having presumably sold valuable baseball cards he collected for the money. Having gotten the bracelet from the mother, they are able to disprove the defense's story and Zack Rowland cuts a deal. Later, McCoy and Van Buren meet at a bar and McCoy reveals that his father was a cop and if his father had been in the same situation, both kids would've been dead, not just one.

Loke and Lucy keep their eyes closed, but by doing so they are unable to dodge Bickslow's attacks. Loke suggests Lucy to close his gate and take shelter into Horologium , but Lucy,who is unable to do so due to the loss of her keys, trusts Loke and asks him to find a solution. And so he does.||||| He wants Lucy to charge in when he hears his signal. Loke uses Lion Brilliance to illuminate the whole area, forcing Bickslow to close his eyes and Lucy attacks and traps him with her whip. Bickslow states that Lucy shouldn't take order from her spirits and cries that Loke cannot defeat him, but Loke responds that he is not what he used to be. He explains that now that he has Lucy, he has regained all his Magic Power with her as his Master and has even become more powerful. He shouts that Love makes Spirits stronger, unlike his dolls, and attacks him with Regulus Impact , defeating Bickslow. Loke gives Lucy her keys (once more), but not before showing her an \"I Love Lucy\" sign. Seconds later Happy rolls his tongue to say He liiiiiikes you , much to Lucy's annoyance.||||| At the guild, Gajeel , Levy and Natsu learn of Lucy's victory. Gajeel is incredulous of this, but Natsu affirms that Lucy is strong. While they bicker, Levy finally cracks Fried 's code, and is able to release them.

Elfman tries to calm her down by telling her to smile at everyone when the battle is over, but is ineffective and Mirajane sobs, feeling guilt-ridden. Meanwhile, Cana and Juvia are looking for Laxus , when they encounter Fried. He traps them inside his Jutsu Shiki , and forces them to fight each-other, if they want to leave. Juvia sacrifices herself by attacking one of the Lacrimas in the air, releasing the Jutsu Shiki. In her last conscious words, she expresses that she just wanted people to accept her as a member of Fairy Tail, but Cana says they already have. She cries that she is her friend and an amazing Fairy Tail Mage, which makes Juvia happy, as she faints, and makes Cana furious and attacks Fried.||||| Meanwhile, Natsu and Gajeel have split up and are looking for Laxus. Gajeel talks through a Shikigami to Master Ivan Dreyar , and he responds that for the time being his mission is to gain the Fairy Tail members' trust, and to not be discovered. He orders him to act as a full fledged Fairy Tail member, and adds that Fairy Tail's punishment will soon come. Mirajane and Elfman unknowingly enter Cana's and Fried's battlefield, and watch as Cana gets defeated. Elfman intervenes, but Fried, deeming him defeated and out of the game, attacks him with Dark Ecriture , torturing him . Mirajane watches, feeling useless, and begs Fried to stop. He doesn't and prepares to use his final spell, Dark Ecriture: Death . This sends Mirajane into a state of shock, in which she remembers the final moments of Lisanna 's life and the pain she went through, imagining the death of her only living sibling.||||| Mirajane's Magic Power awakens in a blast of light and she uses Satan Soul . She jumps at Fried, who is forced to use his Dark Ecriture: Wings to try and evade her, but to no end. Mirajane releases her wings too, and follows him, and attacks with many Darkness Magic Spells. Fried, in response, performs a spell he claims to be forbidden: Dark Ecriture: Darkness . This turns Fried into a Demon too, but Mirajane still has the upper hand. While fighting, she uses various Elemental Magics, before finally managing to incapacitate Fried. When she approaches to deliver the final blow, Lisanna's face and last smile flash through her mind, and Mirajane deactivates Satan Soul. She loses the will to fight, and reminds Fried of their relationship as nakama and that they are from the same Guild, meaning that they are family. Fried, realizing that he dearly treasured the bonds his Guild has given him, begins to cry, admitting that he never wanted to take part in Laxus' plan.

Lucy gets close to Bickslow and attacks him with her whip. Seeing this Bickslow uses his Figure Eyes . Happy orders everyone to close their eyes, and explains its effects. Loke and Lucy keep their eyes closed, but by doing so they are unable to dodge Bickslow's attacks. Loke suggests Lucy to close his gate and take shelter into Horologium , but Lucy,who is unable to do so due to the loss of her keys, trusts Loke and asks him to find a solution. And so he does.||||| He wants Lucy to charge in when he hears his signal. Loke uses Lion Brilliance to illuminate the whole area, forcing Bickslow to close his eyes and Lucy attacks and traps him with her whip. Bickslow states that Lucy shouldn't take order from her spirits and cries that Loke cannot defeat him, but Loke responds that he is not what he used to be. He explains that now that he has Lucy, he has regained all his Magic Power with her as his Master and has even become more powerful. He shouts that Love makes Spirits stronger, unlike his dolls, and attacks him with Regulus Impact , defeating Bickslow. Loke gives Lucy her keys (once more), but not before showing her an \"I Love Lucy\" sign. Seconds later Happy rolls his tongue to say He liiiiiikes you , much to Lucy's annoyance.||||| At the guild, Gajeel , Levy and Natsu learn of Lucy's victory. Gajeel is incredulous of this, but Natsu affirms that Lucy is strong. While they bicker, Levy finally cracks Fried 's code, and is able to release them. Elsewhere, Mirajane finds a wounded Elfman on the ground. She apologizes to him, feeling that during Fairy Tail's crises she was unable to help, and is reduced to tears. Elfman tries to calm her down by telling her to smile at everyone when the battle is over, but is ineffective and Mirajane sobs, feeling guilt-ridden. Meanwhile, Cana and Juvia are looking for Laxus , when they encounter Fried. He traps them inside his Jutsu Shiki , and forces them to fight each-other, if they want to leave. Juvia sacrifices herself by attacking one of the Lacrimas in the air, releasing the Jutsu Shiki. In her last conscious words, she expresses that she just wanted people to accept her as a member of Fairy Tail, but Cana says they already have. She cries that she is her friend and an amazing Fairy Tail Mage, which makes Juvia happy, as she faints, and makes Cana furious and attacks Fried.||||| Meanwhile, Natsu and Gajeel have split up and are looking for Laxus. Gajeel talks through a Shikigami to Master Ivan Dreyar , and he responds that for the time being his mission is to gain the Fairy Tail members' trust, and to not be discovered. He orders him to act as a full fledged Fairy Tail member, and adds that Fairy Tail's punishment will soon come. Mirajane and Elfman unknowingly enter Cana's and Fried's battlefield, and watch as Cana gets defeated. Elfman intervenes, but Fried, deeming him defeated and out of the game, attacks him with Dark Ecriture , torturing him . Mirajane watches, feeling useless, and begs Fried to stop. He doesn't and prepares to use his final spell, Dark Ecriture: Death . This sends Mirajane into a state of shock, in which she remembers the final moments of Lisanna 's life and the pain she went through, imagining the death of her only living sibling.||||| Mirajane's Magic Power awakens in a blast of light and she uses Satan Soul . She jumps at Fried, who is forced to use his Dark Ecriture: Wings to try and evade her, but to no end. Mirajane releases her wings too, and follows him, and attacks with many Darkness Magic Spells. Fried, in response, performs a spell he claims to be forbidden: Dark Ecriture: Darkness . This turns Fried into a Demon too, but Mirajane still has the upper hand. While fighting, she uses various Elemental Magics, before finally managing to incapacitate Fried. When she approaches to deliver the final blow, Lisanna's face and last smile flash through her mind, and Mirajane deactivates Satan Soul. She loses the will to fight, and reminds Fried of their relationship as nakama and that they are from the same Guild, meaning that they are family. Fried, realizing that he dearly treasured the bonds his Guild has given him, begins to cry, admitting that he never wanted to take part in Laxus' plan. With this, the battle of Fairy Tail is near its conclusion.

First up is Rayna-Deacon-Luke.||||| Rayna is confused about what to do, and after a romp with Luke in the hay, talks to Tandy about it the next morning. Tandy can't believe that she would even consider getting back together with Deacon but knows Rayna has to make her own choice. In order to assist in this choice Rayna feels like she has to tell Luke what happened with Deacon. He is understandably upset but also gets where Deacon is coming from, not wanting to lose Rayna again, but he says if it's up to him Deacon will lose indeed.

Trying to put some salve on the situation, the two enter a bar to have a drink, but they miss the fact that they just entered a gay bar called The Gay Blade. Just out of sight, they are spotted by Bubba, one of Fred's friends, who is out on a date with a dithering loudmouth named Lucille. Not understanding that Lamont and Rollo walked into the bar by accident, Bubba immediately jumps to the conclusion that possibly they might be gay. He tells Lucille that he has to take her home because he's got to go and see a \"sick friend.\" Just as Bubba and Lucille shuffle out of sight, Lamont and Rollo exit the bar with Lamont now even more disgusted with Rollo.||||| Back at Sanford and Son, Bubba reports to Fred that he saw Lamont and Rollo walking into The Gay Blade, but Fred initially scoffs at the suggestion, reasoning that the two are always looking for weird places to go. However, the question hangs in the air when Lamont comes home, Fred shuffles Bubba out the door and quizzes his son over why he spends so much time with Rollo instead of his girlfriend Judy Ann. In response (unaware of the nature of Fred's questions) Lamont admits that dating Judy Ann - and women in general - is becoming an aggravation. Fred isn't sure what to make of this. The next day, Fred devises a plan to get Dr. Caldwell to ask Lamont some leading questions about his possible homosexual tendencies under the guise of examining his back, which he wrenched the previous week while lifting a stove. The conversation doesn't reveal much except that Lamont feels that he had a dominant mother but also that he appreciates the presence of a woman in the house. Fred is confused by the results which do not reveal a definite answer.||||| Fred begins to question little things that Lamont does, still trying to find definite signs that he might be gay, such as why he is combing his hair in the middle of the day and why he now wears so much cologne. On a Saturday night, Lamont tells him that he's going out with Rollo but they don't have definite plans. Fred says that he's going out with Bubba to see a horror movie triple-feature. Things seem okay until Fred bumps into Rollo on the way out of the house. Questioning him on why he's always hanging out with Lamont, Fred nearly flies into a panic when Rollo tells \"He's my man!\" With Fred gone, Lamont admits to Rollo that he just got Fred out of the house so that he can have the place all to himself for a romantic date with Judy Ann. Rollo completely understands and leaves.||||| Fred and Bubba skip the movie in favor of a secret plan to return to The Gay Blade incognito (wearing sunglasses) and wait and see if Lamont and Rollo show up. Just as they enter the place, they are spotted by Rollo who immediately jumps to the conclusion that possibly they might be turning gay. He reports back to Lamont and the situation becomes similar to how it was earlier when Bubba saw Lamont and Rollo do the same thing.||||| The evidence is presented (they were wearing sunglasses and sitting at a table in a corner together), Lamont rejects the suggestion, but the doubts still hang in the air as Fred comes back home. Trying to clear the air, Lamont tries asking Fred some leading questions, but just then Judy Ann comes over, confirming that Lamont is, in fact, not gay.

A student, Brian Wilcox, is filming footage at a diner... Brian is at the diner with his friend and roommate Mike Walker, debating about what Brian should make a movie about. As Mike goofs off with his friend's camera, they spot several girls at a booth nearby and Mike good-naturedly suggests they might take pity on Brian. One of the girls, Kate, comes over and asks if they're filming her. She discusses camera technology with Brian but is clearly attracted to Mike.||||| Later, Brian is at the house. Kate and Mike are in the next room making love. Once they're done, Kate comes out, awkwardly says hi to Brian, and goes to the kitchen. Brian, Mike, and Kate go back to the diner and Brian and Kate talk cameras. Mike doesn't know anything about cameras but Kate assures Brian that she's teaching her boyfriend about them. The friends film each other talking about what they plan to do in five years. Kate wants to be an environmentalist, a lawyer, or both.||||| Brian wants to work in Hollywood, and Mike plans to set sail to the middle of the ocean and take things easy. Brian is filming a literature lecture by Professor Ludensky on Lord of the Flies. Kate comes in and confirms that Brian is taping for Mike, who has dozed off again. As they leave, another student, Scott Parker bumps into Brian, knocking his camera to the ground. He runs off and the three friends follow. The police are securing a nearby crime scene where a student, Jacob Carter, was brutally murdered. Sam and Dean, posing as FBI agents, are on the scene. The detective in charge tells them that a neighbor woman reported growling noises and Jacob screams.||||| Back at their house, the three friends discuss what they saw and figure that it's a good thing that the FBI is checking out the murder. Mike puts on the song that was playing at the diner when he first met Kate as a gift to her. Brian asks him to come with him to test some new cameras and Mike agrees. Before he goes, he privately tells Kate that he's going because Brian doesn't have any other friends. Brian and Mike film some footage of the stadium and spot Sam and Dean nearby. They listen in as Sam figures that it's a normal murder but Dean believes that they need to dig deeper. As night falls, Brian and Mike spot Scott and his girlfriend making out behind the bleachers. She slaps Scott and walks away, and Scott spots Mike and Brian and chases after them. The friends split up and Mike records himself as he wanders in the woods. Something attacks him, dragging him off-camera. When Brian finds Mike a little later, he realizes that something has bitten his friend. However, by the time he gets Mike home, the bite mark has vanished.||||| The next day, Mike gets a checkup but the doctor can't find anything wrong with him. As he opens a door, Mike inadvertently rips it off its hinges and they realize that he is now super strong. He lifts Kate one-handed into the air and wonders if he's become a superhero. Brian decides to place cameras throughout the house. When Kate notices, Brian explains that he wants to record Mike's origin story and make a film out of it.||||| As Mike eats, Brian says that he wants to go out and get bitten so that they can both be superheroes. Mike refuses, saying that his friend doesn't want what he has. Brian begs him to do it but Mike refuses. Later, Mike and Kate are using a bong when Sam and Dean arrive at the door. As they hide, Brian answers the door and the brothers ask him if they know anything about Jacob's murder, or rumors of someone being bitten. Brian denies everything and they leave, and Kate and Mike record the brothers out on the porch as they talk about dealing with another Mayan god. They play the tape back for Brian and they wonder if Mike has become a Mayan deity.||||| That night, Kate dozes off and Mike goes to the bathroom mirror and admires himself. However, as he films himself he realizes that he is growing fangs and claws. He smashes the mirror and then goes to look at the sleeping Kate for a minute. After stroking her cheek, he goes down to the kitchen and eats in the refrigerator, but is still hungry. Scott and his friends are out patrolling the neighborhood, looking for the killer animal.||||| Scott films himself and spots Mike, who says that he isn't in the mood for Scott's antics. Mike runs off into the woods and Scott chases after him, calling him a coward and saying that he'll go after Kate if Mike won't turn around and fight him. As Scott tries to spot him, Mike transforms and attacks him. The next morning, Brian wonders if Kate is scared of Michael but she says that his being a superhero is kind of hot. Mike comes in, covered in blood, and his friends stare at him in horror. He takes a shower to wash off the blood and then tells them that he killed Scott. They go over the footage that Mike filmed in the bathroom and see his claws, and Kate tells Brian to turn off the camera.||||| Brian goes to the park where Scott was killed and watches while Sam and Dean talk to the local detective. He tells the brothers that the same thing killed Scott as Jacob and that it left Scott's partially-eaten heart in the street. Michael goes back and tells his friends what happened, but Mike doesn't remember eating the heart. Kate insists that it was self-defense but Brian points out how unlikely that is and snaps at Mike. Mike shoves him across the room with one hand and then creaks down. When he says that he doesn't know who he is anymore, Kate says that he's hers. Brian insists that they have to call the police and that Mike is risking himself and them.||||| Kate angrily tells him that he doesn't understand because he's never been in love and sets out to get some answers about Mike's condition. Mike and Kate follow Sam and Dean to the morgue and listen as Sam tells Dean that ten years ago there was a similar murder. However, it didn't take place during the full moon. Once they leave, Kate wants to follow but Mike doesn't see the point. Brian arrives, having tracked his friends' cell phone GPSs. They wonder if he can hack anything and he assures them that he can. They follow the Winchesters to a diner and Brian hacks the security camera. Mike goes in with a hidden camera and sits at the table next to the brothers. The three friends watch and listen as Sam finds an entry about how close descendants of the Pureblood can control their change and subsist on animal hearts. The brothers figure that one of the purer werewolves came to town, killed its victim, and then decided to stay.||||| The three friends return to their house and Mike starts to panic, figuring the 'FBI' is after him. Kate doesn't believe that the Winchesters are FBI and that they'll start by looking for the pureblood. Mike doesn't believe it and goes to his bedroom and Kate goes after him. They argue while Brian goes over the footage of the original attack on Mike. He spots something on the ground and calls to Kate, but she slams the door shut. Brian has no choice but to go out on his own and examine the attack site. He finds a pin on the ground and realizes that it's the same one that Ludensky was wearing at his last lecture.||||| Brian goes to Ludensky's office and tells him that he knows what the professor really is. Later, Brian comes home and finds Kate packing. As Mike comes out, Brian says that he took care of things and they ask what he did. He shows them footage of his confronting Ludensky and asking the professor to bite him as well. He warns the professor that he hid cameras in his office in advance and is transmitting the video to his laptop at home. Ludensky denies being a werewolf until Brian threatens him with a silver blade. Then he breaks down and explains that after the one murder ten years ago, he only ate animal hearts. However, he saw Jacob, weak and alone, and couldn't resist. Ludensky figured that hunters would come eventually so he needed a patsy. He chose Mike since he's always sleeping in and the professor figured that no one would miss him. Brian says that he wants to become a werewolf and forces the professor to bite his arm.||||| As the footage ends, Brian starts to transform and shows him footage of the office after he left. Sam and Dean come in and attack Ludensky, eventually killing him. With his dying breath, the professor thanks them. The brothers find the camera and take it down, cutting the transmission, and Brian figures that they're safe. He tells Kate that he protected her when Mike couldn't, but Mike figures the Winchesters will trace the feed back to Brian. Brian, angry and disgusted, tells Mike that he's tired of living in his shadow and that he finally has what he wants. Mike tries to persuade his friend that he doesn't want the horror inside of him, the horror that he experienced when he went out of control and killed Scott. Brian tells Kate that she needs him and grabs her, and Mike transforms and attacks him. The two students struggle and Brian stabs Mike with the silver dagger, killing him. Kate goes to her lover, who says with his dying breath that he loves her.||||| Kate tries to stab Brian, who easily grabs her and says that she'll understand... and then bites her. She locks herself in the bathroom and films herself using a camera, and then goes berserk. Kate finally gets control of herself and calls to Brian, saying that she understands. She goes outside and tells Brian that she understands...and then rips his throat out. Afterward, she covers Mike's corpse with a sheet and then sits down at the computer to record her message to the Winchesters.||||| She tells that she and her friends weren't monsters and didn't want what happened to them. Kate then says that she's leaving and that she will eat animal hearts and never hurt anyone, and promises that they won't hear about her. Before signing off, Kate tells the Winchesters to give her a chance. Sam and Dean look at the computer and wonder what to do next. Sam hesitantly suggests that they let her leave. Much to his surprise, Dean agrees, saying that they should give Kate a chance. They can always kill her if she fails to keep her promise. They collect all of the evidence that werewolves were there and leave. Outside of town, Kate hitches a ride to the border and then walks away along the railroad tracks.\n\n \n", "original_narrative": "Sam and Dean burst into a house near a college and search the place. Sam finds a corpse covered with a sheet, a corpse with no ID, and the walls are covered in blood. The brothers find a laptop computer with a note on it saying \"Play me.\" The Winchesters play it and a video starts up with the words \"This should never have ended this way\" come up. A student, Brian Wilcox, is filming footage at a diner... Brian is at the diner with his friend and roommate Mike Walker, debating about what Brian should make a movie about. As Mike goofs off with his friend's camera, they spot several girls at a booth nearby and Mike good-naturedly suggests they might take pity on Brian. One of the girls, Kate, comes over and asks if they're filming her. She discusses camera technology with Brian but is clearly attracted to Mike.||||| Later, Brian is at the house. Kate and Mike are in the next room making love. Once they're done, Kate comes out, awkwardly says hi to Brian, and goes to the kitchen. Brian, Mike, and Kate go back to the diner and Brian and Kate talk cameras. Mike doesn't know anything about cameras but Kate assures Brian that she's teaching her boyfriend about them. The friends film each other talking about what they plan to do in five years. Kate wants to be an environmentalist, a lawyer, or both.||||| Brian wants to work in Hollywood, and Mike plans to set sail to the middle of the ocean and take things easy. Brian is filming a literature lecture by Professor Ludensky on Lord of the Flies. Kate comes in and confirms that Brian is taping for Mike, who has dozed off again. As they leave, another student, Scott Parker bumps into Brian, knocking his camera to the ground. He runs off and the three friends follow. The police are securing a nearby crime scene where a student, Jacob Carter, was brutally murdered. Sam and Dean, posing as FBI agents, are on the scene. The detective in charge tells them that a neighbor woman reported growling noises and Jacob screams.||||| Back at their house, the three friends discuss what they saw and figure that it's a good thing that the FBI is checking out the murder. Mike puts on the song that was playing at the diner when he first met Kate as a gift to her. Brian asks him to come with him to test some new cameras and Mike agrees. Before he goes, he privately tells Kate that he's going because Brian doesn't have any other friends. Brian and Mike film some footage of the stadium and spot Sam and Dean nearby. They listen in as Sam figures that it's a normal murder but Dean believes that they need to dig deeper. As night falls, Brian and Mike spot Scott and his girlfriend making out behind the bleachers. She slaps Scott and walks away, and Scott spots Mike and Brian and chases after them. The friends split up and Mike records himself as he wanders in the woods. Something attacks him, dragging him off-camera. When Brian finds Mike a little later, he realizes that something has bitten his friend. However, by the time he gets Mike home, the bite mark has vanished.||||| The next day, Mike gets a checkup but the doctor can't find anything wrong with him. As he opens a door, Mike inadvertently rips it off its hinges and they realize that he is now super strong. He lifts Kate one-handed into the air and wonders if he's become a superhero. Brian decides to place cameras throughout the house. When Kate notices, Brian explains that he wants to record Mike's origin story and make a film out of it.||||| As Mike eats, Brian says that he wants to go out and get bitten so that they can both be superheroes. Mike refuses, saying that his friend doesn't want what he has. Brian begs him to do it but Mike refuses. Later, Mike and Kate are using a bong when Sam and Dean arrive at the door. As they hide, Brian answers the door and the brothers ask him if they know anything about Jacob's murder, or rumors of someone being bitten. Brian denies everything and they leave, and Kate and Mike record the brothers out on the porch as they talk about dealing with another Mayan god. They play the tape back for Brian and they wonder if Mike has become a Mayan deity.||||| That night, Kate dozes off and Mike goes to the bathroom mirror and admires himself. However, as he films himself he realizes that he is growing fangs and claws. He smashes the mirror and then goes to look at the sleeping Kate for a minute. After stroking her cheek, he goes down to the kitchen and eats in the refrigerator, but is still hungry. Scott and his friends are out patrolling the neighborhood, looking for the killer animal.||||| Scott films himself and spots Mike, who says that he isn't in the mood for Scott's antics. Mike runs off into the woods and Scott chases after him, calling him a coward and saying that he'll go after Kate if Mike won't turn around and fight him. As Scott tries to spot him, Mike transforms and attacks him. The next morning, Brian wonders if Kate is scared of Michael but she says that his being a superhero is kind of hot. Mike comes in, covered in blood, and his friends stare at him in horror. He takes a shower to wash off the blood and then tells them that he killed Scott. They go over the footage that Mike filmed in the bathroom and see his claws, and Kate tells Brian to turn off the camera.||||| Brian goes to the park where Scott was killed and watches while Sam and Dean talk to the local detective. He tells the brothers that the same thing killed Scott as Jacob and that it left Scott's partially-eaten heart in the street. Michael goes back and tells his friends what happened, but Mike doesn't remember eating the heart. Kate insists that it was self-defense but Brian points out how unlikely that is and snaps at Mike. Mike shoves him across the room with one hand and then creaks down. When he says that he doesn't know who he is anymore, Kate says that he's hers. Brian insists that they have to call the police and that Mike is risking himself and them.||||| Kate angrily tells him that he doesn't understand because he's never been in love and sets out to get some answers about Mike's condition. Mike and Kate follow Sam and Dean to the morgue and listen as Sam tells Dean that ten years ago there was a similar murder. However, it didn't take place during the full moon. Once they leave, Kate wants to follow but Mike doesn't see the point. Brian arrives, having tracked his friends' cell phone GPSs. They wonder if he can hack anything and he assures them that he can. They follow the Winchesters to a diner and Brian hacks the security camera. Mike goes in with a hidden camera and sits at the table next to the brothers. The three friends watch and listen as Sam finds an entry about how close descendants of the Pureblood can control their change and subsist on animal hearts. The brothers figure that one of the purer werewolves came to town, killed its victim, and then decided to stay.||||| The three friends return to their house and Mike starts to panic, figuring the 'FBI' is after him.
