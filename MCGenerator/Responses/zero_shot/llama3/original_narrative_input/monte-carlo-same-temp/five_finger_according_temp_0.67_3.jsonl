Here is his brief but spectacular take on what we learn from what we see. I am a natural busybody. For my school projects I would just drive up to farms and make my long way up these driveways and just, \"Hey, how's it going? Can I come take pictures?\" In most situations that I work in, most people want somebody to talk to and you're there to listen to what they have to say and in some ways comfort them for their loss. I've been to almost every major wildfire in California, including the biggest one called the Thomas Fire. The thing I heard on the radio made me realize that this was unstoppable, that firefighters were telling each other that, \"We're out of units. You're on your own. We just don't have enough resource to send your way,\" and that's when I knew things were getting out of control. At one point I waited on top of a hill waiting for the fire to come to me and I waited a little too long and I remember having to drive through this wall of flame with my car. I can feel the heat that's searing my skin inside that car that was protected by all that metal and glass and air conditioning. The common idea that people have is that the news media is just running around taking pictures, reporting from wildfires without any sensitivity, but in reality we're just trying to do our jobs. Trying to get as much information about the conditions of the fire, how far it's spread and all that stuff. I was at the Erskine Fire in Lake Isabella and I came across this one home that was getting surrounded by fire and had this tattered American flag. I jumped out of the vehicle and took a photo of that and I moved on and I didn't think much of it. The homeowner for that home was actually nearby, saw me do that and thought less of me. He actually ended up following our coverage for the rest of the fire, looked up the work that we did and wrote me this beautiful letter. \"Dear Marcus Yam, I stood a few feet from you when you took this picture of my home. I thought to myself another vulture sensationalizing on people's misery. After seeing this photograph and looking at your portfolio, I was wrong. You portray human emotion without all the makeup and glamour. You have my respect. My home withstood the test that night and old glory still waves. Today I replaced that tattered flag with a new and shiny one. I would like you to take care of that old flag for me. Sincerely, Darryl Snyder.\" My name is Marcus Yam.

I've been to almost every major wildfire in California, including the biggest one called the Thomas Fire. The thing I heard on the radio made me realize that this was unstoppable, that firefighters were telling each other that, \"We're out of units. You're on your own. We just don't have enough resource to send your way,\" and that's when I knew things were getting out of control. At one point I waited on top of a hill waiting for the fire to come to me and I waited a little too long and I remember having to drive through this wall of flame with my car. I can feel the heat that's searing my skin inside that car that was protected by all that metal and glass and air conditioning. The common idea that people have is that the news media is just running around taking pictures, reporting from wildfires without any sensitivity, but in reality we're just trying to do our jobs. Trying to get as much information about the conditions of the fire, how far it's spread and all that stuff. I was at the Erskine Fire in Lake Isabella and I came across this one home that was getting surrounded by fire and had this tattered American flag. I jumped out of the vehicle and took a photo of that and I moved on and I didn't think much of it. The homeowner for that home was actually nearby, saw me do that and thought less of me. He actually ended up following our coverage for the rest of the fire, looked up the work that we did and wrote me this beautiful letter. \"Dear Marcus Yam, I stood a few feet from you when you took this picture of my home. I thought to myself another vulture sensationalizing on people's misery. After seeing this photograph and looking at your portfolio, I was wrong. You portray human emotion without all the makeup and glamour. You have my respect. My home withstood the test that night and old glory still waves. Today I replaced that tattered flag with a new and shiny one. I would like you to take care of that old flag for me. Sincerely, Darryl Snyder.\" My name is Marcus Yam.

He recalls a particular incident where he took a photo of a tattered American flag in front of a home surrounded by fire, and was initially judged by the homeowner.

I had to be the mom figure, I had to be the student, the best friend, the sister, everything. With my little brother, he was only four at the time and he would cry every night for my mom. When I was nine I did get depression but not really anxiety, more depression, because I would cry every night, especially with Bobby. I would sleep hugging him and stuff, and it was bad.

But now, we switched roles because he was my caregiver and now I'm his caregiver. Oh my God, my graduation, it was so much fun. Okay. So I took pictures with my best friend, Damien, then we went out to eat with my family. I was going to surprise my dad.

{"Prompt": "Story: Tonight, we turn to another installment of our weekly \"brief but spectacular\" series, where we ask people about their passion. Tonight we hear from attorney Robin Steinberg. She's CEO of the Bail Project. It's a national organization whose mission is to combat mass incarceration, by paying bail for tens of thousands of low income Americans at risk of pretrial detention.  So when I became a public defender, I had no idea how the bail system operated. And it doesn't take long when you're a public defender to stand in a courtroom next to a client, watch a judge set bail, and have the client turn to you and say, \"I don't have that money.\" And inevitably what happens is the client will turn to you and say, \"I'll just plead guilty. They'll let me go home.\" And you want to scream and you think to yourself, nobody should go to a jail cell because they don't have any money. But that's what happens every day. So jail is terrifying and it's violent and it's dehumanizing. It can do everything from destroy your mental health to your physical health. You can be sexually victimized. You can be one of the many jail deaths that happen in the first week of jail. You can lose your home, you can lose custody of your children, you can be deported. There's a whole cascade of problems that can happen, and destruction that happens to you and your family and to your community, even if you're there for one day, two days, or three days in jail. It's a horrifying place to be. So the Bail Project is an unprecedented effort to disrupt the money bail system. The idea is to create a central bail fund that we will then use to open sites in at least 40 places in America, where we can begin to use philanthropic dollars to pay people's bail who don't have enough money to get out of those jail cells. Remember, these are people that have not been convicted of anything. These are people that are simply charged with something. By using philanthropic dollars, we actually pay somebody's bail and at the end of a criminal case, because bail money comes back, it will revolve back into the fund. Bail was actually created to be a form of release. It wasn't intended to hold people in jail cells and it wasn't intended to create a two-tiered system of justice, one for the rich and one for everybody else, but that is exactly what it's done. 75% of people in American local jails are there because they cannot pay bail. These people haven't been convicted of a thing. Until we grapple with what the reality is and how our country has been addicted to imprisonment for as long as it has existed, and since slavery to mass incarceration have happened, we're never going to get at the root of the problem. At the root of the problem, there is structural racism at the root of the problem there is income inequality, and those are big issues we need to deal with. We also need to really ask ourselves, do we believe in the presumption of innocence or don't we? If we believe in the presumption of innocence, then when somebody is arrested, that presumption should wrap around them. And if we don't believe in it, let's grapple with that.
