I really didn't know how to parent. I knew how to be an aunt. You know, when I was just the aunt and you guys were jumping on the bed, then I could jump on the bed too. But now that I had to be the parent, I realized that things had really changed. After you came to live with me, you had to have some minor surgery and in the recovery room you were asking for your mommy and this was not a moment in time to do a whole bunch of explaining about why your mommy's not there. So I just said to you, \"I'm right here.\" My voice is a lot like your mom's and so you were fine. And then I tried really hard to cook the things that your mom made and you both wouldn't tolerate it. I remember thinking that she was going to come and pick you up, the experiment was over and she would come and get you, but that couldn't happen.\u201d Then Phil asks, \u201cSo where do you feel we are now?\u201d and Abby answers, \u201cYou know, when you first came to live with me, there was no doubt in my mind I was your aunt, you were my nephew, Laura was my niece, which always then requires a huge explanation when people want to figure out why my niece and nephew live with me. And now, I think of you as my son and I think of her as my daughter and I see no difference there at all.\u201d Then Phil says, \u201cYou know that we've always been very appreciative of what you've done for us. Though, the things that have happened to us have been really difficult and really hard.

Desmond asks his mother, \u201cWhat emergency drills did you have as you were growing up in school?\u201d She replies, \u201cFire drills and tornado drills, and that was it. So can you tell me exactly what happens in active shooter drills?\u201d Desmond says, \u201cThe teacher's supposed to lock the door, turn the lights off, and push this big desk behind the door.

So I decided to come help her because if she doesn't get the desk on the door in time, the intruder can open it.\u201d Then his mother asks, \u201cSo what do you do next, after you push the table?\u201d He answers, \u201cThe class is supposed to stand on the back wall, but I decided to stand in front of the class because I want to take the bullet and save my friends.\u201d His mother asks, \u201cSo did your teacher ask you to stand in front of the class?\u201d Desmond replies, \u201cNo. My life matters, but it's kind of like there is one person that can come home to a family, or there can be 22 people that come to home to a family.\u201d She asks him, \u201cDo you know why it's hard for me to accept that?\u201d He answers, \u201cBecause I'm such a young age.

In tonight's \"Brief But Spectacular\", Naomi de la Rosa was a child when her mother was deported for illegally entering the US. Now an 18 year old freshman at the University of Arizona, de la Rosa shares her family's story. When my mom got deported, I was nine years old. She crossed, I think, in the 1990s. She was always working daily at the motels, cleaning rooms and everything, and she would get home around six in the afternoon, and she would still have to clean and cook and stuff. She's about to finish her 10 year sentence next October in 2019. Ever since my mom got deported, it was really tough. I had to be the mom figure, I had to be the student, the best friend, the sister, everything. With my little brother, he was only four at the time and he would cry every night for my mom. When I was nine I did get depression but not really anxiety, more depression, because I would cry every night, especially with Bobby. I would sleep hugging him and stuff, and it was bad. But then at school I would always have a smile on my face because I didn't want people to ask, \"Oh, what's wrong?\" And then me having to cry again over my mom and tell them the same story over and over again. My father is already 86. I remember when I was small he would take me to McDonald's and he would get me the little toys and everything. But now, we switched roles because he was my caregiver and now I'm his caregiver. Oh my God, my graduation, it was so much fun. Okay. So I took pictures with my best friend, Damien, then we went out to eat with my family. I was going to surprise my dad. He was in the bathroom washing his hands so he can eat his chicken nuggets or whatever. My dad was being brought down the hallway with my little brother and I was there waiting at the door. I popped up with my diploma and stuff, and then my dad started crying and then I was crying. He was like, \"Oh my God. I'm so proud of you.\" But in Spanish. He was like, \"Oh my God. Mi hija. Ya se gradu\u00f3.\u201d And I was like, \"I did it for you.\" But yeah, it was a memorable night.

Oh, I need to do this. Oh, I need to do that.\" For me, I surpassed all those obstacles and I graduated, and now I got a full ride to the U of A. So it's like, \"Oh my God. I did it.\" It's nice.

Tonight we hear from attorney Robin Steinberg. She's CEO of the Bail Project. It's a national organization whose mission is to combat mass incarceration, by paying bail for tens of thousands of low income Americans at risk of pretrial detention.  So when I became a public defender, I had no idea how the bail system operated. And it doesn't take long when you're a public defender to stand in a courtroom next to a client, watch a judge set bail, and have the client turn to you and say, \"I don't have that money.\" And inevitably what happens is the client will turn to you and say, \"I'll just plead guilty. They'll let me go home.\" And you want to scream and you think to yourself, nobody should go to a jail cell because they don't have any money. But that's what happens every day. So jail is terrifying and it's violent and it's dehumanizing. It can do everything from destroy your mental health to your physical health. You can be sexually victimized. You can be one of the many jail deaths that happen in the first week of jail. You can lose your home, you can lose custody of your children, you can be deported. There's a whole cascade of problems that can happen, and destruction that happens to you and your family and to your community, even if you're there for one day, two days, or three days in jail. It's a horrifying place to be. So the Bail Project is an unprecedented effort to disrupt the money bail system. The idea is to create a central bail fund that we will then use to open sites in at least 40 places in America, where we can begin to use philanthropic dollars to pay people's bail who don't have enough money to get out of those jail cells. Remember, these are people that have not been convicted of anything. These are people that are simply charged with something. By using philanthropic dollars, we actually pay somebody's bail and at the end of a criminal case, because bail money comes back, it will revolve back into the fund. Bail was actually created to be a form of release. It wasn't intended to hold people in jail cells and it wasn't intended to create a two-tiered system of justice, one for the rich and one for everybody else, but that is exactly what it's done. 75% of people in American local jails are there because they cannot pay bail. These people haven't been convicted of a thing. Until we grapple with what the reality is and how our country has been addicted to imprisonment for as long as it has existed, and since slavery to mass incarceration have happened, we're never going to get at the root of the problem. At the root of the problem, there is structural racism at the root of the problem there is income inequality, and those are big issues we need to deal with. We also need to really ask ourselves, do we believe in the presumption of innocence or don't we? If we believe in the presumption of innocence, then when somebody is arrested, that presumption should wrap around them. And if we don't believe in it, let's grapple with that. But if we believe in it, nobody should be sitting in jail cells who haven't been convicted of anything.

The idea is to create a central bail fund that we will then use to open sites in at least 40 places in America, where we can begin to use philanthropic dollars to pay people's bail who don't have enough money to get out of those jail cells. Remember, these are people that have not been convicted of anything. These are people that are simply charged with something. By using philanthropic dollars, we actually pay somebody's bail and at the end of a criminal case, because bail money comes back, it will revolve back into the fund. Bail was actually created to be a form of release. It wasn't intended to hold people in jail cells and it wasn't intended to create a two-tiered system of justice, one for the rich and one for everybody else, but that is exactly what it's done. 75% of people in American local jails are there because they cannot pay bail. These people haven't been convicted of a thing. Until we grapple with what the reality is and how our country has been addicted to imprisonment for as long as it has existed, and since slavery to mass incarceration have happened, we're never going to get at the root of the problem. At the root of the problem, there is structural racism at the root of the problem there is income inequality, and those are big issues we need to deal with. We also need to really ask ourselves, do we believe in the presumption of innocence or don't we? If we believe in the presumption of innocence, then when somebody is arrested, that presumption should wrap around them. And if we don't believe in it, let's grapple with that. But if we believe in it, nobody should be sitting in jail cells who haven't been convicted of anything.
