I really didn't know how to parent. I knew how to be an aunt. You know, when I was just the aunt and you guys were jumping on the bed, then I could jump on the bed too. But now that I had to be the parent, I realized that things had really changed. After you came to live with me, you had to have some minor surgery and in the recovery room you were asking for your mommy and this was not a moment in time to do a whole bunch of explaining about why your mommy's not there. So I just said to you, \"I'm right here.\" My voice is a lot like your mom's and so you were fine.

And now, I think of you as my son and I think of her as my daughter and I see no difference there at all.\u201d Then Phil says, \u201cYou know that we've always been very appreciative of what you've done for us.

Trying to get as much information about the conditions of the fire, how far it's spread and all that stuff. I was at the Erskine Fire in Lake Isabella and I came across this one home that was getting surrounded by fire and had this tattered American flag. I jumped out of the vehicle and took a photo of that and I moved on and I didn't think much of it. The homeowner for that home was actually nearby, saw me do that and thought less of me. He actually ended up following our coverage for the rest of the fire, looked up the work that we did and wrote me this beautiful letter. \"Dear Marcus Yam, I stood a few feet from you when you took this picture of my home. I thought to myself another vulture sensationalizing on people's misery. After seeing this photograph and looking at your portfolio, I was wrong. You portray human emotion without all the makeup and glamour. You have my respect. My home withstood the test that night and old glory still waves. Today I replaced that tattered flag with a new and shiny one. I would like you to take care of that old flag for me. Sincerely, Darryl Snyder.\" My name is Marcus Yam.

He recalls his experience covering wildfires in California, including the Thomas Fire, where he waited on a hill for the fire to approach and had to drive through a wall of flames to escape. Despite the common perception that journalists are insensitive, Yam emphasizes that they're just trying to do their job and provide information about the fire. He shares a personal anecdote about taking a photo of a tattered American flag at a home surrounded by fire, which initially earned him the homeowner's disdain, but later earned his respect after the homeowner saw Yam's portfolio and wrote him a heartfelt letter.

{"Prompt": "Story: Tonight, we turn to another installment of our weekly \"brief but spectacular\" series, where we ask people about their passion. Tonight we hear from attorney Robin Steinberg. She's CEO of the Bail Project. It's a national organization whose mission is to combat mass incarceration, by paying bail for tens of thousands of low income Americans at risk of pretrial detention.  So when I became a public defender, I had no idea how the bail system operated. And it doesn't take long when you're a public defender to stand in a courtroom next to a client, watch a judge set bail, and have the client turn to you and say, \"I don't have that money.\" And inevitably what happens is the client will turn to you and say, \"I'll just plead guilty. They'll let me go home.\" And you want to scream and you think to yourself, nobody should go to a jail cell because they don't have any money. But that's what happens every day. So jail is terrifying and it's violent and it's dehumanizing. It can do everything from destroy your mental health to your physical health. You can be sexually victimized. You can be one of the many jail deaths that happen in the first week of jail. You can lose your home, you can lose custody of your children, you can be deported. There's a whole cascade of problems that can happen, and destruction that happens to you and your family and to your community, even if you're there for one day, two days, or three days in jail. It's a horrifying place to be. So the Bail Project is an unprecedented effort to disrupt the money bail system. The idea is to create a central bail fund that we will then use to open sites in at least 40 places in America, where we can begin to use philanthropic dollars to pay people's bail who don't have enough money to get out of those jail cells. Remember, these are people that have not been convicted of anything. These are people that are simply charged with something. By using philanthropic dollars, we actually pay somebody's bail and at the end of a criminal case, because bail money comes back, it will revolve back into the fund. Bail was actually created to be a form of release. It wasn't intended to hold people in jail cells and it wasn't intended to create a two-tiered system of justice, one for the rich and one for everybody else, but that is exactly what it's done. 75% of people in American local jails are there because they cannot pay bail. These people haven't been convicted of a thing. Until we grapple with what the reality is and how our country has been addicted to imprisonment for as long as it has existed, and since slavery to mass incarceration have happened, we're never going to get at the root of the problem. At the root of the problem, there is structural racism at the root of the problem there is income inequality, and those are big issues we need to deal with. We also need to really ask ourselves, do we believe in the presumption of innocence or don't we? If we believe in the presumption of innocence, then when somebody is arrested, that presumption should wrap around them. And if we don't believe in it, let's grapple with that.
