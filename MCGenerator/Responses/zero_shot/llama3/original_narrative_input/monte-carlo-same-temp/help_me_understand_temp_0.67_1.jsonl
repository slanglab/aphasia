I had to be the mom figure, I had to be the student, the best friend, the sister, everything. With my little brother, he was only four at the time and he would cry every night for my mom. When I was nine I did get depression but not really anxiety, more depression, because I would cry every night, especially with Bobby. I would sleep hugging him and stuff, and it was bad.

{"Prompt": "Suppose you are a story-reteller, generate a list of main concepts to help me understand the story.\n\nOriginal Story: Tonight, we turn to another installment of our weekly \"brief but spectacular\" series, where we ask people about their passion. Tonight we hear from attorney Robin Steinberg. She's CEO of the Bail Project. It's a national organization whose mission is to combat mass incarceration, by paying bail for tens of thousands of low income Americans at risk of pretrial detention.  So when I became a public defender, I had no idea how the bail system operated. And it doesn't take long when you're a public defender to stand in a courtroom next to a client, watch a judge set bail, and have the client turn to you and say, \"I don't have that money.\" And inevitably what happens is the client will turn to you and say, \"I'll just plead guilty. They'll let me go home.\" And you want to scream and you think to yourself, nobody should go to a jail cell because they don't have any money. But that's what happens every day. So jail is terrifying and it's violent and it's dehumanizing. It can do everything from destroy your mental health to your physical health. You can be sexually victimized. You can be one of the many jail deaths that happen in the first week of jail. You can lose your home, you can lose custody of your children, you can be deported. There's a whole cascade of problems that can happen, and destruction that happens to you and your family and to your community, even if you're there for one day, two days, or three days in jail. It's a horrifying place to be. So the Bail Project is an unprecedented effort to disrupt the money bail system. The idea is to create a central bail fund that we will then use to open sites in at least 40 places in America, where we can begin to use philanthropic dollars to pay people's bail who don't have enough money to get out of those jail cells. Remember, these are people that have not been convicted of anything. These are people that are simply charged with something. By using philanthropic dollars, we actually pay somebody's bail and at the end of a criminal case, because bail money comes back, it will revolve back into the fund. Bail was actually created to be a form of release. It wasn't intended to hold people in jail cells and it wasn't intended to create a two-tiered system of justice, one for the rich and one for everybody else, but that is exactly what it's done. 75% of people in American local jails are there because they cannot pay bail. These people haven't been convicted of a thing. Until we grapple with what the reality is and how our country has been addicted to imprisonment for as long as it has existed, and since slavery to mass incarceration have happened, we're never going to get at the root of the problem. At the root of the problem, there is structural racism at the root of the problem there is income inequality, and those are big issues we need to deal with. We also need to really ask ourselves, do we believe in the presumption of innocence or don't we? If we believe in the presumption of innocence, then when somebody is arrested, that presumption should wrap around them. And if we don't believe in it, let's grapple with that. But if we believe in it, nobody should be sitting in jail cells who haven't been convicted of anything.

It's a horrifying place to be. So the Bail Project is an unprecedented effort to disrupt the money bail system. The idea is to create a central bail fund that we will then use to open sites in at least 40 places in America, where we can begin to use philanthropic dollars to pay people's bail who don't have enough money to get out of those jail cells. Remember, these are people that have not been convicted of anything. These are people that are simply charged with something. By using philanthropic dollars, we actually pay somebody's bail and at the end of a criminal case, because bail money comes back, it will revolve back into the fund. Bail was actually created to be a form of release. It wasn't intended to hold people in jail cells and it wasn't intended to create a two-tiered system of justice, one for the rich and one for everybody else, but that is exactly what it's done. 75% of people in American local jails are there because they cannot pay bail. These people haven't been convicted of a thing. Until we grapple with what the reality is and how our country has been addicted to imprisonment for as long as it has existed, and since slavery to mass incarceration have happened, we're never going to get at the root of the problem. At the root of the problem, there is structural racism at the root of the problem there is income inequality, and those are big issues we need to deal with. We also need to really ask ourselves, do we believe in the presumption of innocence or don't we? If we believe in the presumption of innocence, then when somebody is arrested, that presumption should wrap around them. And if we don't believe in it, let's grapple with that. But if we believe in it, nobody should be sitting in jail cells who haven't been convicted of anything. My name is Robin Steinberg, and this is my \"brief but spectacular\" take on disrupting the money bail system and turning the tide on mass incarceration in America.", "row": 7, "response": "Here are the main concepts to help you understand the story:\n\n1. **The Bail Project**: A national organization aiming to combat mass incarceration by paying bail for low-income Americans at risk of pretrial detention.\n2. **Mass Incarceration**: The phenomenon of a large number of people being imprisoned, often disproportionately affecting low-income communities and communities of color.\n3. **Bail System**: A system where a judge sets a monetary amount for a defendant to pay to be released from jail while awaiting trial.\n4. **Pretrial Detention**: The practice of holding defendants in jail while they await trial, often due to inability to pay bail.\n5. **Structural Racism**: Systemic and institutional racism that perpetuates inequality and discrimination, particularly in the criminal justice system.\n6. **Income Inequality**: The significant disparity in income and wealth between different socioeconomic groups, leading to unequal access to resources and opportunities.\n7. **Presumption of Innocence**: The principle that a defendant is considered innocent until proven guilty, which is often compromised by the bail system.\n8. **Consequences of Jail Time**: The devastating effects of even short periods of jail time on individuals, families, and communities, including mental and physical health problems, loss of employment, housing, and custody of children, and increased risk of sexual victimization and death.\n9. **Philanthropic Bail Fund**: A central fund using philanthropic dollars to pay bail for low-income individuals, which can be replenished when bail money is returned at the end of a criminal case.\n10. **Disrupting the Money Bail System**: The goal of the Bail Project to challenge and transform the current bail system, which perpetuates inequality and injustice.", "decomposed_mcs": ["The Bail Project is a national organization.", "The Bail Project aims to combat mass incarceration.", "The Bail Project pays bail for low-income Americans at risk of pretrial detention.", "Mass Incarceration is a phenomenon.", "Mass Incarceration is the phenomenon of a large number of people being imprisoned.", "Mass Incarceration often disproportionately affects low-income communities.", "Mass Incarceration often disproportionately affects communities of color.", "A judge sets a monetary amount for a defendant to pay to be released from jail while awaiting trial in a Bail System.", "Pretrial detention is the practice of holding defendants in jail while they await trial.", "Pretrial detention is often due to inability to pay bail.", "Structural Racism is systemic and institutional racism.", "Structural Racism perpetuates inequality.", "Structural Racism perpetuates discrimination.", "Structural Racism perpetuates inequality and discrimination particularly in the criminal justice system.", "Income Inequality is a significant disparity in income and wealth between different socioeconomic groups.", "Income Inequality leads to unequal access to resources and opportunities.", "Presumption of Innocence is the principle that a defendant is considered innocent until proven guilty.", "The principle that a defendant is considered innocent until proven guilty is often compromised by the bail system.", "Jail time has devastating effects on individuals.", "Jail time has devastating effects on families.", "Jail time has devastating effects on communities.", "Jail time causes mental health problems.", "Jail time causes physical health problems.", "Jail time causes loss of employment.", "Jail time causes loss of housing.", "Jail time causes loss of custody of children.", "Jail time increases the risk of sexual victimization.", "Jail time increases the risk of death.", "Philanthropic Bail Fund is a central fund.", "Philanthropic Bail Fund uses philanthropic dollars to pay bail for low-income individuals.", "Philanthropic Bail Fund can be replenished when bail money is returned at the end of a criminal case.", "The goal of the Bail Project is to disrupt the Money Bail System.", "The goal of the Bail Project is to challenge the current bail system.", "The goal of the Bail Project is to transform the current bail system.", "The current bail system perpetuates inequality.", "The current bail system perpetuates injustice."]}
