I had to be the mom figure, I had to be the student, the best friend, the sister, everything. With my little brother, he was only four at the time and he would cry every night for my mom. When I was nine I did get depression but not really anxiety, more depression, because I would cry every night, especially with Bobby. I would sleep hugging him and stuff, and it was bad.

{"Prompt": "Suppose you are a story-reteller, generate a list of main concepts to help me understand the story.\n\nOriginal Story: Tonight, we turn to another installment of our weekly \"brief but spectacular\" series, where we ask people about their passion. Tonight we hear from attorney Robin Steinberg. She's CEO of the Bail Project. It's a national organization whose mission is to combat mass incarceration, by paying bail for tens of thousands of low income Americans at risk of pretrial detention.  So when I became a public defender, I had no idea how the bail system operated. And it doesn't take long when you're a public defender to stand in a courtroom next to a client, watch a judge set bail, and have the client turn to you and say, \"I don't have that money.\" And inevitably what happens is the client will turn to you and say, \"I'll just plead guilty. They'll let me go home.\" And you want to scream and you think to yourself, nobody should go to a jail cell because they don't have any money. But that's what happens every day. So jail is terrifying and it's violent and it's dehumanizing. It can do everything from destroy your mental health to your physical health. You can be sexually victimized. You can be one of the many jail deaths that happen in the first week of jail. You can lose your home, you can lose custody of your children, you can be deported. There's a whole cascade of problems that can happen, and destruction that happens to you and your family and to your community, even if you're there for one day, two days, or three days in jail. It's a horrifying place to be. So the Bail Project is an unprecedented effort to disrupt the money bail system. The idea is to create a central bail fund that we will then use to open sites in at least 40 places in America, where we can begin to use philanthropic dollars to pay people's bail who don't have enough money to get out of those jail cells. Remember, these are people that have not been convicted of anything. These are people that are simply charged with something. By using philanthropic dollars, we actually pay somebody's bail and at the end of a criminal case, because bail money comes back, it will revolve back into the fund. Bail was actually created to be a form of release. It wasn't intended to hold people in jail cells and it wasn't intended to create a two-tiered system of justice, one for the rich and one for everybody else, but that is exactly what it's done. 75% of people in American local jails are there because they cannot pay bail. These people haven't been convicted of a thing. Until we grapple with what the reality is and how our country has been addicted to imprisonment for as long as it has existed, and since slavery to mass incarceration have happened, we're never going to get at the root of the problem. At the root of the problem, there is structural racism at the root of the problem there is income inequality, and those are big issues we need to deal with. We also need to really ask ourselves, do we believe in the presumption of innocence or don't we? If we believe in the presumption of innocence, then when somebody is arrested, that presumption should wrap around them. And if we don't believe in it, let's grapple with that. But if we believe in it, nobody should be sitting in jail cells who haven't been convicted of anything.

It wasn't intended to hold people in jail cells and it wasn't intended to create a two-tiered system of justice, one for the rich and one for everybody else, but that is exactly what it's done. 75% of people in American local jails are there because they cannot pay bail. These people haven't been convicted of a thing. Until we grapple with what the reality is and how our country has been addicted to imprisonment for as long as it has existed, and since slavery to mass incarceration have happened, we're never going to get at the root of the problem. At the root of the problem, there is structural racism at the root of the problem there is income inequality, and those are big issues we need to deal with. We also need to really ask ourselves, do we believe in the presumption of innocence or don't we? If we believe in the presumption of innocence, then when somebody is arrested, that presumption should wrap around them. And if we don't believe in it, let's grapple with that. But if we believe in it, nobody should be sitting in jail cells who haven't been convicted of anything. My name is Robin Steinberg, and this is my \"brief but spectacular\" take on disrupting the money bail system and turning the tide on mass incarceration in America.", "row": 7, "response": "Here are the main concepts to help you understand the story:\n\n1. **The Bail Project**: A national organization aimed at combating mass incarceration by paying bail for low-income Americans at risk of pretrial detention.\n2. **Mass Incarceration**: The phenomenon of a large number of people being imprisoned, often disproportionately affecting low-income communities and communities of color.\n3. **Bail System**: A system where a judge sets a monetary amount that a defendant must pay to be released from jail while awaiting trial.\n4. **Pretrial Detention**: The practice of holding defendants in jail while they await trial, often because they cannot afford bail.\n5. **Income Inequality**: The unequal distribution of income and resources, which can lead to systemic injustices, including mass incarceration.\n6. **Structural Racism**: The ways in which racial biases are embedded in institutions, policies, and practices, perpetuating racial disparities and injustices.\n7. **Presumption of Innocence**: The principle that a person is considered innocent until proven guilty, which is often not upheld in the current bail system.\n8. **Consequences of Jail Time**: The devastating effects of even short periods of jail time, including mental and physical health problems, loss of home and custody of children, and increased risk of sexual victimization and death.\n9. **Philanthropic Bail Fund**: A central fund that uses donations to pay bail for individuals who cannot afford it, with the goal of disrupting the money bail system.\n10. **Reform Goals**: The ultimate goals of the Bail Project, including reducing mass incarceration, addressing income inequality and structural racism, and upholding the presumption of innocence.", "decomposed_mcs": ["The Bail Project is a national organization.", "The Bail Project aims at combating mass incarceration.", "The Bail Project pays bail for low-income Americans at risk of pretrial detention.", "Mass Incarceration is a phenomenon.", "Mass Incarceration is the phenomenon of a large number of people being imprisoned.", "Mass Incarceration often disproportionately affects low-income communities.", "Mass Incarceration often disproportionately affects communities of color.", "A judge sets a monetary amount in a Bail System.", "The monetary amount is paid by a defendant in a Bail System.", "The defendant pays the monetary amount to be released from jail in a Bail System.", "The defendant is released from jail while awaiting trial in a Bail System.", "Pretrial detention is the practice of holding defendants in jail while they await trial.", "Defendants are often held in jail while they await trial because they cannot afford bail.", "Income Inequality is the unequal distribution of income and resources.", "Income Inequality can lead to systemic injustices.", "Income Inequality can lead to mass incarceration.", "Racial biases are embedded in institutions.", "Racial biases are embedded in policies.", "Racial biases are embedded in practices.", "Racial biases perpetuate racial disparities.", "Racial biases perpetuate racial injustices.", "Presumption of Innocence is the principle that a person is considered innocent until proven guilty.", "The principle that a person is considered innocent until proven guilty is often not upheld in the current bail system.", "Jail time has devastating effects.", "Jail time includes mental health problems.", "Jail time includes physical health problems.", "Jail time includes loss of home.", "Jail time includes loss of custody of children.", "Jail time includes increased risk of sexual victimization.", "Jail time includes increased risk of death.", "Philanthropic Bail Fund is a central fund.", "Philanthropic Bail Fund uses donations to pay bail for individuals who cannot afford it.", "The goal of Philanthropic Bail Fund is to disrupt the money bail system.", "The ultimate goals of the Bail Project include reducing mass incarceration.", "The ultimate goals of the Bail Project include addressing income inequality.", "The ultimate goals of the Bail Project include addressing structural racism.", "The ultimate goals of the Bail Project include upholding the presumption of innocence."]}
