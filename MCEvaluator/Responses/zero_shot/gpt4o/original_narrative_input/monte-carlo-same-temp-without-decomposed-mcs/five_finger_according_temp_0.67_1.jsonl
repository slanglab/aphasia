As a public defender, she saw how the bail system unfairly punished those who couldn't afford to pay, leading to guilty pleas and devastating consequences. The Bail Project aims to disrupt the money bail system by creating a central fund to pay bail for those who can't afford it, with the goal of opening sites in 40 locations across America. Steinberg argues that the current system is unjust, with 75% of people in local jails unable to pay bail, and that it perpetuates structural racism and income inequality. She believes that the presumption of innocence should protect individuals from pretrial detention, and that the Bail Project is a crucial step towards turning the tide on mass incarceration in America.\n\nCandidate Concepts:\n1.
