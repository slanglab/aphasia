Then, I will give you a numbered list of candidate concepts. For each candidate concept, indicate whether it is supported by the list of main concepts. If it is supported, provide the span of text from the main concepts that support your answer; otherwise, provide an explanation of why it is not supported. Based on your explanation, predict \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d for each candidate concept. Output your response by numbering the candidate concepts in the order they are presented.\nProvide output in the following format exactly:\n[\n{\"MC\": 1, \"span\": \"explanation\", \"is_supported\": \"yes\" or \"no\"},\n{\"MC\": 2, \"span\": \"explanation\", \"is_supported\": \"yes\" or \"no\"},\n...\n]\n\nMain Concepts:\nHere are the main concepts mentioned in the story using the 7-unit story grammar:\n\n**1. Setting**: The setting is not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred to be the United States, specifically the criminal justice system and local jails.\n\n**2. Characters in the story**: The main character is Robin Steinberg, an attorney and CEO of the Bail Project.\n\n**3. Initiating Event (IE)**: The initiating event is Robin Steinberg's experience as a public defender, where she saw clients unable to pay bail and being forced to plead guilty or stay in jail.\n\n**4. Internal Response (IR)**: Robin Steinberg's internal response is one of outrage and frustration, as she thinks to herself, \"Nobody should go to a jail cell because they don't have any money.\"\n\n**5. Internal Plan (IP)**: Robin Steinberg's internal plan is to create a national organization, the Bail Project, to combat mass incarceration by paying bail for low-income Americans at risk of pretrial detention.\n\n**6. Attempt (ATT)**: The attempt is the creation of the Bail Project, which aims to disrupt the money bail system by creating a central bail fund to pay people's bail and opening sites in at least 40 places in America.\n\n**7. Outcome or Consequence of the attempt**: The desired outcome is to reduce mass incarceration, address structural racism and income inequality, and ensure that people are not detained in jail cells simply because they cannot afford bail. The consequence of the attempt is the potential to create a more just and equitable criminal justice system.\n\nCandidate Concepts:\n1. Robin Steinberg founded the Bail Project\n2. The Bail Project pays bail for low-income Americans\n3. Clients frequently can't afford to pay bail\n4. Jail negatively impacts prisoners' lives\n5. Money paid for bail revolves back into the fund\n6. The justice system shouldn't favor the rich\n7. Income inequality and/or structural racism are the root of the problem\n\n\nOnly provide the output in the specified format and nothing else (e.g., introductory texts, explanations, or reasons).\n", "raw_eval_completion": "```json\n[\n    {\"MC\": 1, \"span\": \"Robin Steinberg's internal plan is to create a national organization, the Bail Project\", \"is_supported\": \"yes\"},\n    {\"MC\": 2, \"span\": \"The attempt is the creation of the Bail Project, which aims to disrupt the money bail system by creating a central bail fund to pay people's bail\", \"is_supported\": \"yes\"},\n    {\"MC\": 3, \"span\": \"The initiating event is Robin Steinberg's experience as a public defender, where she saw clients unable to pay bail\", \"is_supported\": \"yes\"},\n    {\"MC\": 4, \"span\": \"explanation\", \"is_supported\": \"no\"},\n    {\"MC\": 5, \"span\": \"explanation\", \"is_supported\": \"no\"},\n    {\"MC\": 6, \"span\": \"explanation\", \"is_supported\": \"no\"},\n    {\"MC\": 7, \"span\": \"The desired outcome is to reduce mass incarceration, address structural racism and income inequality\", \"is_supported\": \"yes\"}\n]\n```", "gold_coverage": {"1": 1, "2": 1, "3": 1, "4": 0, "5": 0, "6": 0, "7": 1}, "recall": 0.5714285714285714, "yield_num_toks": 1285}
