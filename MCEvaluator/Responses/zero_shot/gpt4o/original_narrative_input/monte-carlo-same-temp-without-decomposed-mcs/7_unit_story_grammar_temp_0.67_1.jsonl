Based on your explanation, predict \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d for each candidate concept.

Setting**: The setting is not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred to be the United States, specifically the criminal justice system and local jails.\n\n**2. Characters in the story**: The main character is Robin Steinberg, an attorney and CEO of the Bail Project.\n\n**3. Initiating Event (IE)**: The initiating event is Robin Steinberg's experience as a public defender, where she saw clients who couldn't afford bail and were forced to plead guilty or stay in jail.\n\n**4. Internal Response (IR)**: Robin's internal response is her outrage and frustration at the injustice of the bail system, where people are detained simply because they can't afford bail.\n\n**5. Internal Plan (IP)**: Robin's internal plan is to create a national organization, the Bail Project, to combat mass incarceration by paying bail for low-income Americans at risk of pretrial detention.\n\n**6. Attempt (ATT)**: The attempt is the Bail Project's effort to disrupt the money bail system by creating a central bail fund and opening sites in at least 40 places in America to pay people's bail using philanthropic dollars.\n\n**7. Outcome or Consequence of the attempt**: The desired outcome is to reduce mass incarceration, address structural racism and income inequality, and ensure that people are not detained simply because they can't afford bail. The consequence of the attempt is a potential shift in the criminal justice system, where the presumption of innocence is upheld, and people are not punished simply because of their economic status.\n\nCandidate Concepts:\n1. Robin Steinberg founded the Bail Project\n2. The Bail Project pays bail for low-income Americans\n3. Clients frequently can't afford to pay bail\n4. Jail negatively impacts prisoners' lives\n5. Money paid for bail revolves back into the fund\n6. The justice system shouldn't favor the rich\n7. Income inequality and/or structural racism are the root of the problem\n\n\nOnly provide the output in the specified format and nothing else (e.g., introductory texts, explanations, or reasons).\n", "raw_eval_completion": "```json\n[\n{\"MC\": 1, \"span\": \"Robin Steinberg, an attorney and CEO of the Bail Project.\", \"is_supported\": \"yes\"},\n{\"MC\": 2, \"span\": \"The attempt is the Bail Project's effort to disrupt the money bail system by creating a central bail fund and opening sites in at least 40 places in America to pay people's bail using philanthropic dollars.\", \"is_supported\": \"yes\"},\n{\"MC\": 3, \"span\": \"The initiating event is Robin Steinberg's experience as a public defender, where she saw clients who couldn't afford bail and were forced to plead guilty or stay in jail.\", \"is_supported\": \"yes\"},\n{\"MC\": 4, \"span\": \"The desired outcome is to reduce mass incarceration, address structural racism and income inequality, and ensure that people are not detained simply because they can't afford bail.\", \"is_supported\": \"no\"},\n{\"MC\": 5, \"span\": \"No mention of money paid for bail revolving back into the fund.\", \"is_supported\": \"no\"},\n{\"MC\": 6, \"span\": \"The desired outcome is to reduce mass incarceration, address structural racism and income inequality, and ensure that people are not detained simply because they can't afford bail.\", \"is_supported\": \"yes\"},\n{\"MC\": 7, \"span\": \"The desired outcome is to reduce mass incarceration, address structural racism and income inequality, and ensure that people are not detained simply because they can't afford bail.\", \"is_supported\": \"yes\"}\n]\n```", "gold_coverage": {"1": 1, "2": 1, "3": 1, "4": 0, "5": 0, "6": 1, "7": 1}, "recall": 0.7142857142857143, "yield_num_toks": 1351}
