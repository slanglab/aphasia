Then, I will give you a numbered list of candidate concepts. For each candidate concept, indicate whether it is supported by the list of main concepts.

Setting**: The setting is not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred to be the United States, specifically the criminal justice system and local jails.\n\n**2. Characters in the story**: The main character is Robin Steinberg, an attorney and CEO of the Bail Project.\n\n**3. Initiating Event (IE)**: The initiating event is Robin Steinberg's experience as a public defender, where she saw clients who couldn't afford bail and were forced to plead guilty or stay in jail.\n\n**4. Internal Response (IR)**: Robin Steinberg's internal response is her outrage and frustration at the injustice of the bail system, expressed through phrases like \"you want to scream\" and \"nobody should go to a jail cell because they don't have any money.\"\n\n**5. Internal Plan (IP)**: Robin Steinberg's internal plan is to combat mass incarceration by paying bail for low-income Americans at risk of pretrial detention through the Bail Project.\n\n**6. Attempt (ATT)**: The attempt is the creation of the Bail Project, a national organization that aims to disrupt the money bail system by paying bail for tens of thousands of low-income Americans.\n\n**7. Outcome or Consequence of the attempt**: The desired outcome is to reduce mass incarceration, address structural racism and income inequality, and ensure that people are not detained in jail simply because they cannot afford bail. The consequence of the attempt is the potential to create a more just and equitable criminal justice system.\n\nCandidate Concepts:\n1. Robin Steinberg founded the Bail Project\n2. The Bail Project pays bail for low-income Americans\n3. Clients frequently can't afford to pay bail\n4. Jail negatively impacts prisoners' lives\n5. Money paid for bail revolves back into the fund\n6. The justice system shouldn't favor the rich\n7.
