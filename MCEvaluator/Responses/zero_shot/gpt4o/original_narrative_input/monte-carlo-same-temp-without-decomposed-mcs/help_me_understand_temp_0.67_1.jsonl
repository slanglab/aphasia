Then, I will give you a numbered list of candidate concepts. For each candidate concept, indicate whether it is supported by the list of main concepts. If it is supported, provide the span of text from the main concepts that support your answer; otherwise, provide an explanation of why it is not supported. Based on your explanation, predict \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d for each candidate concept. Output your response by numbering the candidate concepts in the order they are presented.\nProvide output in the following format exactly:\n[\n{\"MC\": 1, \"span\": \"explanation\", \"is_supported\": \"yes\" or \"no\"},\n{\"MC\": 2, \"span\": \"explanation\", \"is_supported\": \"yes\" or \"no\"},\n...\n]\n\nMain Concepts:\nHere are the main concepts to help you understand the story:\n\n1. **The Bail Project**: A national organization aiming to combat mass incarceration by paying bail for low-income Americans at risk of pretrial detention.\n2. **Mass Incarceration**: The phenomenon of a large number of people being imprisoned, often disproportionately affecting low-income communities and communities of color.\n3. **Bail System**: A system where a judge sets a monetary amount for a defendant to pay to be released from jail while awaiting trial.\n4. **Pretrial Detention**: The practice of holding defendants in jail while they await trial, often due to inability to pay bail.\n5. **Structural Racism**: Systemic and institutional racism that perpetuates inequality and discrimination, particularly in the criminal justice system.\n6. **Income Inequality**: The significant disparity in income and wealth between different socioeconomic groups, leading to unequal access to resources and opportunities.\n7. **Presumption of Innocence**: The principle that a defendant is considered innocent until proven guilty, which is often compromised by the bail system.\n8. **Consequences of Jail Time**: The devastating effects of even short periods of jail time on individuals, families, and communities, including mental and physical health problems, loss of employment, housing, and custody of children, and increased risk of sexual victimization and death.\n9. **Philanthropic Bail Fund**: A central fund using philanthropic dollars to pay bail for low-income individuals, which can be replenished when bail money is returned at the end of a criminal case.\n10. **Disrupting the Money Bail System**: The goal of the Bail Project to challenge and transform the current bail system, which perpetuates inequality and injustice.\n\nCandidate Concepts:\n1.
