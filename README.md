This is the official repository for our paper: Automated main concept generation for
narrative discourse assessment in aphasia. This repository contains code to reproduce the modeling experiments discussed in our paper.

An earlier version of this work was presented at the Clinical Aphasiology Conference 2025. The conference abstract is available in the ```CAC2025``` directory.
