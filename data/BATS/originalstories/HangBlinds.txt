Give your windows the proper treatment with new window blinds. It's a simple project. Here's what you need to know to hang horizontal blinds. There are two ways to mount your blinds. Inside mounts fit inside the frame. Outside mounts attach to the wall or trim. You'll need to measure your windows according to how you'll mount the blinds, inside or outside. Then check the package directions for picking the right size. Mark the width and cut according to the directions. Next, mark the center of the window opening and lightly mark the center of the blind head rail. Then hold the brackets in place, mark the holes, drill pilot holes and secure with screws. Mark the center bracket location, drill pilot holes and attach the bracket. Now lock the blind in place. To finish up the installation, attach the wand to the hook, and snap on the valance clips and valance. Insert the bottom rail end caps too. If you're blind is too long, you can shorten it. Lower it all the way and cut out the extra slats. Don't cut the bottom rail or strings. Next, cut just the horizontal ladder strings. Remove the plugs from the bottom rail. Slide the bottom rail up the strings, twist the cords back into the bottom rail and replace the plugs. Another tip. To keep an extended blind from moving and swaying, install optional hold-down brackets. To install them, lower the blind. Hold the bracket in place, mark, and drill pilot holes. Then secure with screws. The rail clips onto the brackets. Another project finished and a finished look for your window.
