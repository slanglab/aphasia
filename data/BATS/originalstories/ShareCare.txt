The video starts with a little boy running along train tracks and playing with a tire and a stick. He sits down on the steps watching a woman wash her clothes in a river. He turns and notices that there is a 50 rupi bill stuck to his tire. He is so happy to have found this money and starts imagining all the things he could buy with it such as ice cream and candy. He decides to go to the village market and look around for something to buy with his money. As he watches a man eating some ice cream, he suddenly hears a big crashing sound. He turns around and sees that a soccer ball has broken some glasses a woman was selling. A boy stands nearby looking guilty and nervous that the woman will yell at him. Instead, she gives him back his ball, ruffles his hair, smiles, and sends him on his way. The woman then begins to clean up the mess of broken glass. The boy with the 50 rupi bill has watched all of this occur. Seeing the kindness of the woman for not getting angry at the other boy, he gets an idea and runs off. When the woman is finished cleaning up the broken glass on the ground, she turns around to see a new set of identical glasses. Surprised, she tries to look around and find whoever performed this act of kindness, but the little boy is already walking away with a big smile on his face. The video ends with the words “share” “care” and “joy.”
