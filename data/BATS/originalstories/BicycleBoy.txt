The video starts with an alarm clock ringing at 6 o’clock and a man getting out of bed to start his day. It shows him riding his bicycle through the countryside until he finally gets to his destination where he picks up newspapers. As he continues riding, he is handing out and delivering newspapers throughout the town. Then we see someone getting out of bed feeling for a pair of sunglasses. He then steps out of bed and uses a cane to walk. He seems to be blind. He goes and sits outside on his porch. Next, the bicycle boy shows up at the blind man’s home and sits down to read the newspaper to him. It becomes clear that they are in India. At the end of the video, we see a message of how the world is full of nice people and if you can’t find one you should be one.
