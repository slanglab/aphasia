This video begins with a man sitting at a table handing an empty plate to Charlie Chaplin. Chaplin wipes some dirt from the plate and then pulls an old shoe out of a soup pot on the stove. He ladles broth onto the shoe as if it is a piece of meat. We see that Chaplin is missing one of his shoes. Chaplin sits down at the table and gets ready to carve the shoe. He places the shoelaces on a separate plate. He removes the leather part of the shoe from the sole which has nails sticking out of it. He then hands the sole and nails over to the other man while keeping the top leather section for himself. The other man quickly switches the plates and gives the sole of the shoe with the nails back to Chaplin, keeping the leather part for himself. The man then eyes the shoe suspiciously and looks over to Chaplin for guidance. Chaplin takes a bite out of the sole, chews it, and swallows it. The other man begrudgingly begins eating his portion. Meanwhile, Chaplin seems to be enjoying his feast, sucking the meat off of every nail. One nail is bent and after licking it clean, Chaplin offers it to the other man like a wishbone. He continues eating the sole, as it begins to give him indigestion.
