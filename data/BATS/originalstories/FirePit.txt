Cozy up to a toasty fire with the new backyard fire pit. This simple kit makes this a great project for any level DIYer. The fire pit will have a thin paver base, three rows of blocks, and a metal ring insert. Other fire pits can be made from rectangular retaining wall blocks, or by setting the pit in-ground. Check out our other videos for those instructions. Safety first. Pick a spot away from your house, and away from low-hanging limbs. If you're installing on a paver patio, be sure to line the bottom with fire blocks to protect the polymeric sand. After finding the right location, mark the fire pit layout. Using a compass made of a stake, string and marking paint. Remove the sod and dirt to a depth of two inches, and tamp down. Keep it as level as possible. Next, add about two inches of gravel base, wet it and tamp down. Then add another half inch and tamp again, keeping the base level. Next, lay the first row of blocks, making sure the sides are touching. Check the size with the metal ring. Then set the second row in place, staggering the joints of the first row. When it looks good, remove each block and apply concrete adhesive, then reposition them. Do the same for the third row. With the blocks in place, set the metal ring inside. After the adhesive cures, fill the inside of the pit with lava rock, to the bottom of the ring insert. Add some kindling and logs and relax next to the warm glow of a backyard fire.
